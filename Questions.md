## Questions

Here are 20 multiple-choice questions for CRNA students, designed based on the provided source material.

### **Section 1: Introduction and Overview**

**1. According to the historical overview, who was the self-trained British anaesthetist recognized as the most distinguished innovator in tracheal intubation, particularly for his work with soldiers requiring facial and airway surgery?**

**Section 1: History of Anesthesia**

A) Joseph Clover

B) John Snow

C) Sir Ivan Magill

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The text states, "The most distinguished innovator in tracheal intubation was the self-trained British anaesthetist Ivan (later, Sir Ivan) Magill." His work in 1919 with patients who needed unrestricted access to the face and airway led to significant advances in tracheal anesthesia.

**2. A new anesthesia machine is delivered to the operating room. During the initial setup, the CRNA notices that the nitrous oxide pipeline hose can be connected to the oxygen inlet on the machine. Based on the principles of anesthesia safety standards, this situation represents a failure of which key safety development?**

**Section 1: Safety Standards**

A) The development of patient monitoring systems like capnography

B) The implementation of electronic anesthesia records (AIMS)

C) The work of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Committee Z79

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The text highlights that safety features were coordinated by the ANSI Committee Z79. A primary goal of such standards is to prevent equipment mix-ups, such as the "nitrous oxide-carbon dioxide mix-up despite current safety standards" mentioned in the text. The inability to cross-connect gas hoses is a direct result of these safety standards.

### **Section 2: Basic Science and Fundamentals**

**3. A CRNA student is reviewing the primary mechanism of action for many general anesthetics. According to the provided text, what effect do clinical concentrations of anesthetics like halothane and enflurane have on GABA-activated chloride currents?**

**Section 2: Mechanisms of Anesthesia and Consciousness**

A) They directly gate GABAa currents without the presence of GABA

B) They antagonize GABA-elicited chloride currents, causing CNS excitation

C) They potentiate GABA-elicited chloride currents

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The text and Figure 10-3 explicitly state and show that "Clinical concentrations of halothane and enflurane potentiate GABA-elicited chloride currents." This potentiation of inhibitory transmission is a key mechanism for many general anesthetics.

**4. A research team is evaluating a new surgical procedure by comparing it to a sham procedure to determine its true efficacy. Based on the discussion of experimental design, why is this type of trial design, as used in the historical example of a procedure for angina pectoris, critically important?**

**Section 2: Experimental Design and Statistics**

A) It allows for the use of a Student's t-test to compare mean values between the two groups.

B) It is the only design that allows for the calculation of a sample mean as an estimator of the population mean.

C) It demonstrates the procedure's benefit by controlling for placebo effects and biases in both patients and observers.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The text describes a trial for angina pectoris where "the lack of benefit was demonstrated in a trial where some patients had the procedure and some had a sham procedure." This design is essential for evaluating if an intervention's observed effects are real or due to psychological/placebo factors, thus providing a higher level of evidence.

### **Section 3: Cardiac Anatomy and Physiology**

**5. Which of the following best describes the cardiac cycle as defined in the provided text?**

**Section 3: Cardiac Cycle**

A) The process of myosin-actin interaction translated into changes in muscle tension and length.

B) The relationship between wall stress, heart rate, and myocardial oxygen consumption.

C) A coordinated, temporally related series of electrical, mechanical, and valvular events.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states, "The cardiac cycle is a coordinated, temporally related series of electrical, mechanical, and valvular events." This definition encapsulates the comprehensive nature of the events occurring with each heartbeat.

**6. A patient with severe coronary artery disease is undergoing non-cardiac surgery. The CRNA aims to minimize myocardial oxygen demand (MVO2). Based on the determinants of MVO2 discussed in the text, which intraoperative goal is most critical for the CRNA to manage?**

**Section 3: Cardiac Anatomy**

A) Maintaining a high preload to ensure adequate ventricular filling.

B) Increasing systemic vascular resistance to improve coronary perfusion pressure.

C) Controlling heart rate and wall stress.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The text identifies the principal determinants of MVO2 as "wall stress, heart rate, and contractility." Therefore, managing these factors by preventing tachycardia and hypertension (which increases wall stress) is a primary strategy to protect the myocardium from ischemia.

### **Section 4: Anesthetic Drugs and Adjuvants**

**7. A patient reports an allergy to "Novocaine." The CRNA understands that this drug belongs to a specific class of local anesthetics. Following the synthesis of procaine (Novocaine), what class of local anesthetics was subsequently developed that is associated with a decreased incidence of allergic reactions?**

**Section 4: Local Anesthetics**

A) Amino amides

B) Liposomal-bupivacaine formulations

C) Amino esters

**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:** The text states that after the development of the amino ester procaine (Novocaine), "all local anesthetics developed and marketed have been of the amino amide variety," citing advantages such as a "decreased incidence of allergic reactions." Lidocaine was the first of this class.

**8. A 10-year-old male with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) requires an urgent appendectomy. When selecting anesthetic agents, the CRNA must consider the specific risks associated with this patient population. Which combination of agents should be avoided due to the risk of rhabdomyolysis and severe hyperkalemia?**

**Section 4: Inhalation Anesthetics**

A) Propofol and rocuronium

B) Sevoflurane and succinylcholine

C) Midazolam and fentanyl

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The text warns that patients with DMD are at risk for "rhabdomyolysis and severe hyperkalemia following succinylcholine administration, and possibly, halogenated inhaled anesthetics." It further states that a prudent approach would be to use halogenated anesthetics only when necessary, making the combination particularly risky.

**9. A patient received a large dose of rocuronium for a difficult airway and the surgeon finishes the procedure unexpectedly early. The patient has profound neuromuscular blockade (0 twitches on TOF). Which reversal strategy would be most effective and appropriate based on its mechanism of action described in the text?**

**Section 4: Neuromuscular Blocking Agents**

A) Administering neostigmine, as it will effectively antagonize the block at the neuromuscular junction regardless of depth.

B) Administering sugammadex, as it directly encapsulates the aminosteroidal NMBA, leading to rapid reversal.

C) Allowing for spontaneous recovery, as this is the safest option for profound blockade.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The text describes sugammadex as a "modified y-cyclodextrin that encapsulates aminosteroidal neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., rocuronium...)." This mechanism leads to a "swift decline of free muscle relaxant in the plasma and rapid reversal," making it the ideal choice for reversing deep blockade from rocuronium.

### **Section 5: Preoperative Assessment and Perioperative Monitoring**

**10. During a preoperative assessment, a 55-year-old patient is evaluated. The patient's history includes well-controlled hypertension, social alcohol use, and a BMI of 35 kg/m². According to the ASA Physical Status Classification System examples provided, what is the correct ASA classification for this patient?**

**Section 5: ASA Physical Status**

A) ASA I

B) ASA II

C) ASA III

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The table "ASA Physical Status Modifiers and Base Unit Assignments" provides examples for ASA II as "A patient with mild systemic disease." The specific examples listed include "social alcohol drinker, pregnancy, obesity (30 < BMI < 40), well-controlled DM/HTN," all of which align with this patient's profile.

**11. A CRNA is performing a preoperative assessment on a 45-year-old female who is a nonsmoker and has a history of motion sickness. She is scheduled for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and the surgeon plans to prescribe postoperative opioids for pain. Based on the Apfel simplified risk score factors mentioned, how should the CRNA categorize this patient's risk for PONV?**

**Section 5: Preoperative Assessment**

A) Low risk, as she has only one minor risk factor.

B) Moderate risk, as she has two of the four major risk factors.

C) High risk, as she has all four major risk factors.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The text identifies the four Apfel risk factors as "female gender, prior history of motion sickness or postoperative nausea, nonsmoking, and the use of postoperative opioids." This patient presents with all four, placing her in the highest risk category, with a predicted PONV incidence of approximately 80%.

**12. A 68-year-old patient with long-standing, severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) presents for a total knee arthroplasty. During the preoperative airway assessment, the CRNA should have a high index of suspicion for a difficult intubation primarily due to which potential complication of RA?**

**Section 5: Preoperative Assessment**

A) Restrictive lung disease and pleural effusions.

B) Atlantoaxial instability leading to spinal cord injury.

C) RA of the temporomandibular joint impeding mouth opening.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** While RA is a multisystem disease, the text specifically highlights airway concerns, stating, "Although not as common, RA of the temporomandibular joint may impede mouth opening for tracheal intubation." This makes TMJ involvement a primary concern for difficult airway management.

### **Section 6: Basic Anesthetic Management**

**13. Immediately after tracheal intubation, the CRNA begins to assess for correct placement. According to the principles of airway management outlined in the text, what is considered the gold standard for verification of tracheal intubation?**

**Section 6: Control of the Airway**

A) Visualization of the tube passing through the vocal cords.

B) Auscultation of bilateral breath sounds and absence of epigastric sounds.

C) Sustained detection of exhaled carbon dioxide.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states, "The gold standard for verification of tracheal intubation is sustained detection of exhaled carbon dioxide." While other methods are used adjunctively, capnography provides the most definitive confirmation.

**14. A patient with a bowel obstruction presents for an emergency laparotomy. The CRNA plans a rapid-sequence induction (RSI). What is the primary goal of performing the RSI technique in this clinical scenario?**

**Section 6: Control of the Airway**

A) To blunt the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation.

B) To gain control of the airway in the shortest amount of time after the ablation of protective airway reflexes.

C) To facilitate mask ventilation prior to administering a neuromuscular blocking agent.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The text defines the goal of RSI as "to gain control of the airway in the shortest amount of time after the ablation of protective airway reflexes with the induction of general anesthesia." This is done to minimize the risk of gastric content aspiration in patients who are not NPO or are at high risk.

**15. A 75-year-old patient remains unresponsive 45 minutes after the conclusion of a 3-hour surgery under general anesthesia with sevoflurane and rocuronium. The CRNA must systematically evaluate the cause of delayed emergence. Based on the information provided, which of the following represents the most logical initial diagnostic approach?**

**Section 6: Emergence from Anesthesia**

A) Assume the cause is excessive opioid administration and immediately administer naloxone.

B) Evaluate for residual neuromuscular blockade and consider other anesthetic-related causes before investigating metabolic or neurologic issues.

C) Immediately send the patient for a head CT to rule out an intraoperative stroke.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The text discusses multiple causes of delayed emergence, including anesthetic-related factors and residual paralysis. Given the agents used, assessing for residual neuromuscular blockade (a common and reversible cause) and considering the prolonged effects of inhaled anesthetics in the elderly is the most prudent and systematic first step before moving to more invasive or less likely causes. The text mentions "Residual paralysis after emergence from anesthesia" as a significant concern.

### **Section 7: Anesthesia Subspecialty Care**

**16. A patient is undergoing a craniotomy for tumor resection. The neurosurgeon requests that the patient be kept "dry" to reduce brain edema. How should the CRNA respond to this request based on the principles of fluid management in neurosurgery?**

**Section 7: Neuroanesthesia**

A) Comply by restricting fluids and administering diuretics to achieve a negative fluid balance.

B) Prioritize maintaining euvolemia with isotonic fluids, explaining that this is critical for maintaining cerebral perfusion.

C) Administer hypotonic solutions to decrease serum sodium and reduce cerebral edema.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The text explicitly challenges the practice of keeping patients "dry," stating, "This strategy is generally not considered optimal, as the primary goal of fluid management in neurosurgical cases should be to maintain cerebral perfusion." It further clarifies that maintaining perfusion is a more important consideration and will actually lessen edema, and the goal should be to keep the patient euvolemic.

**17. A patient is placed in the beach chair position for a shoulder arthroscopy. The CRNA places the arterial line transducer at the level of the heart. What is the critical implication of this transducer position for assessing cerebral perfusion?**

**Section 7: Cerebral Perfusion**

A) The measured mean arterial pressure (MAP) will accurately reflect cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) without adjustment.

B) The measured MAP will be significantly lower than the actual cerebral MAP, leading to unnecessary vasopressor use.

C) The measured MAP will be higher than the actual cerebral MAP, potentially masking cerebral hypoperfusion.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The text explains the hydrostatic gradient effect: "for every 1.25 cm of height difference between the heart and the head, there is a 1-mmHg drop in mean arterial pressure (MAP)." It gives an example where a 20-cm rise causes a 15-mmHg fall in cerebral MAP. Therefore, monitoring pressure at the heart level overestimates the pressure at the brain, creating a risk of unrecognized hypotension and inadequate cerebral perfusion.

**18. A patient with a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) has an intracranial pressure (ICP) of 28 mmHg and a MAP of 80 mmHg. The CRNA must implement strategies for cerebral protection. Which intervention is most consistent with the goals of neuroresuscitation described in the text?**

**Section 7: Traumatic Brain Injury**

A) Administering albumin to increase oncotic pressure and draw fluid from the brain.

B) Inducing profound hypothermia to a core temperature of 12°C to 18°C.

C) Maintaining CPP above 60 mmHg while initiating therapies to reduce ICP, such as administering mannitol.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The text states that for TBI management, "CPP should always be kept above 60 mmHg...to maintain cerebral perfusion." It also mentions that the goals of neuroresuscitation include "reduction of ICP" and "initiation of therapies for cerebral protection." The use of mannitol or hypertonic saline is discussed as a primary therapy for reducing elevated ICP in TBI.

### **Section 8: Anesthesia for Selected Surgical Services**

**19. During a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with the patient in steep Trendelenburg position, the high-pressure alarm on the ventilator sounds, and the SpO2 begins to drop. The CRNA notes absent breath sounds over the left chest. What is the most likely cause of this event?**

**Section 8: Laparoscopic Surgery**

A) A gas embolism from CO2 insufflation.

B) Development of a tension pneumothorax.

C) Migration of the endotracheal tube into the right mainstem bronchus.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The text explicitly states, "Migration of the endotracheal tube into a bronchus is a risk during laparoscopic surgery. This is due to displacement of the diaphragm into the thorax caused by abdominal insufflation, as well as Trendelenburg positioning." This combination of physiologic changes makes endobronchial intubation a common and high-priority differential.

**20. A CRNA is preparing for a lengthy robotic-assisted prostatectomy. Which anesthetic consideration is of primary importance due to the nature of robotic surgery?**

**Section 8: Robotic Surgery**

A) The need for high-dose narcotic techniques to manage the intense surgical stimulation.

B) The increased risk of ventricular fibrillation caused by electrocoagulation near the heart.

C) The limited access to the patient once the robot is docked, requiring meticulous preparation and securing of lines and the airway.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The text emphasizes a key challenge of robotic surgery: "Access to the patient during robotic-assisted surgery may be limited, which is especially significant in the event of an emergency." It also notes that "Anesthetic management during laparoscopic robotic surgery requires preparing for patient accessibility limitations." This makes pre-emptive and thorough setup crucial.
