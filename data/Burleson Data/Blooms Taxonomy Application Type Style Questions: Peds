An 11-month-old infant presents for a palatoplasty, your choice of blade is a MAC 1; as you instrument the airway you appreciate the vallecula and place the blade in that area.  However, as you lift to expose the glottic opening, you are unable to visualize anything resembling the glottis, what is your next move and why?

Switch to a Miller 0 – 1 blade or attempt to use the MAC as a Miller bc the epiglottis is obstructing your view of the vocal cords
Call for the fiberoptic, pull out the MAC blade and mask the patient while you wait for your equipment bc the patient has a difficult airway
Pull the MAC blade out and prepare for emergency front of neck access (eFONA) bc this is now a cannot intubate situation

A 22-month-old toddler with bronchopulmonary dysplasia presents for revision of gastrostomy tube for ongoing reflux.  Based on Ficks law of diffusion, what are you going to anticipate if an inhalational induction is attempted and why?

Prolonged inhalational induction time due to thickened airway membranes
Prolonged inhalational induction time due to an lower partition coefficient
Prolonged inhalational induction time due to an increase in pressure gradients

You are in the OB suite, tending to the mama during a spinal for a cesarean delivery of a 39-week 3-day old.  The proceduralist deems it an appropriate time to clamp the umbilical cord, how are you anticipating this will affect the neonate? 

Increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) leading to an increased aortic & left atrial pressure, closing the foramen ovale
Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) leading to an increased pulmonic & right atrial pressure, maintaining foramen ovale patency
Increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) leading to an increased pulmonic & right atrial pressure, maintaining foramen ovale patency
Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) leading to an increased aortic & left atrial pressure, closing the foramen ovale

You are in the OB suite, tending to the mama during a spinal for a cesarean delivery of a 39-week 3-day old.  As the proceduralist pulls the neonate out of the amniotic sac and out into the extrauterine environment, how are you anticipating this will affect the neonate? 

Increase in the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen leading to a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), & facilitating blood to be pumped from the right ventricle to the lungs
Decrease in the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen leading to an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), & preventing blood from being pumped from the right ventricle to the lung
Increase in the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen leading to a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), & preventing blood from being pumped from the right ventricle to the lungs

A 5-day-old with a PCA of 30 weeks and a diagnosis of left hypoplastic heart syndrome presents for a hybrid Norwood procedure.  As you dose the neuromuscular blockade, what are you expecting the Train-of-Four (ToF) ratio response accuracy to be?

83%
95%
100%

A 5-month-old with a PCA of 55 weeks and a diagnosis of left hypoplastic heart syndrome presents for a redo sternotomy & flash comprehensive stage II Norwood procedure.  As you dose the neuromuscular blockade, what are you expecting the Train-of-Four (ToF) ratio response accuracy to be?

A 10-day-old with a PCA of 32 weeks is in the operating room for emergency laparotomy due to suspected necrotizing enterocolitis. During induction of anesthesia, the intubation is prolonged due to difficulty visualizing the glottis. Why does the oxygen saturation drop so rapidly (Choose three)?

VO2 6 – 9 ml/kg/min
10% the alveoli found in the adult
FRC 18ml/kg
Vd 1ml/kg
Decreased parasympathetic response
Increased type I muscle fibers

A 3-year-old child with a history of frequent upper respiratory infections presents for a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. During intubation, you note no palpable resistance when advancing the endotracheal tube (ETT) through the vocal cords and arbitrarily inflate the ETT cuff; after the procedure is complete and you deep extubate the kiddo, you appreciate stridor. What is the most likely cause of stridor?

Post-intubation croup
Upper respiratory infection
Aspiration of blood

Answer : 1

A 6-month-old infant with a known craniofacial anomaly presents for elective cleft palate repair. During preoperative evaluation, the anesthesia team suspects a difficult airway. What is the best approach to maintain safety during induction and airway management?

Ensure spontaneous ventilation
Perform an RSI
Perform awake fiberoptic
