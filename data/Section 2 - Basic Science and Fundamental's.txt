Conclusions and Future Directions
1	Phenotype-driven classification fails to accurately predict perioperative outcomes or treatment response. An
increasing number of genetic association studies suggest that susceptibility to a range of common adverse
perioperative events and ensuing critical illness is genetically and epigenetically determined. Ongoing emphasis
is placed on prioritizing genetic variants that warrant clinical action, assessing their combined predictive ability
through polygenic risk scores, and integration with the electronic health record data for clinical decision support.
2	Emerging approaches utilizing "omics," physiomarkers, and imaging allow precise perioperative diagnosis and
therapy. Potential applications of biomarkers in perioperative medicine and critical illness include prognosis,
diagnosis, and monitoring of adverse events, as well as informing therapeutic decisions along the surgical patient
journey. Very few have been rigorously evaluated to demonstrate incremental discriminatory accuracy when added
to existing risk stratification models (clinical validity), or change therapy (clinical utility). Among the most promising
remain natriuretic peptides and C-reactive protein (CRP) for cardiovascular risk prediction, postoperative troponin
surveillance to diagnose myocardial injury, and procalcitonin to assess infection in the critically ill.
3	Interindividual variability in response to anesthetic agents is as high as 24% and has underlying genetic
mechanisms.
r4 Individual variability in analgesic responsiveness is attributed to genetic control of peripheral nociceptive pathways
and descending central pain modulatory pathways.
5	Pharmacogenomic variation in genes modulating drug actions explains part of the variability in drug response and
has shown promising clinical utility for several classes of drugs used perioperatively.
6	To facilitate translation to medical practice, systematic evaluation of existing genomic evidence for clinical decisions
in the perioperative continuum, updating the practice guidelines, as well as identifying the revenue sources
to reimburse the generation and use of genomic information are still required. Deliverables of this approach
include classification of patients to enhance clinical trial design both in the acute perioperative period and during
long-term recovery; biomarkers to select candidates for therapeutic intervention and track the efficacy of the
intervention; and predictive models to increase discrimination of recovery probabilities in surgical patients.
Scientific Rationale for
Perioperative Precision Medicine
Intrinsic variability exists across the human population in mor-
phology, behavior, physiology, development, and disease sus-
ceptibility. Of particular relevance to our specialty, responses to
stressful stimuli and drug therapy are also variable. As we appre-
ciate in our daily practices in the operating rooms and intensive
care units, one hallmark of perioperative physiology is the wide
range of patient responses to the acute and sometimes repeated
exposures to a collection of robust perturbations to homeosta-
sis induced by surgical injury, hemodynamic challenges, vascular
cannulations, mechanical circulatory support, intra-aortic balloon

Complex perioperative and critical illness phenotypes listed above are
highly heterogeneous in nature, with multiple subphenotypes, and
therefore will require a new translational classification system focused
on causal biologic pathways that characterize an individual patient's
response to injury in order to enable precision medicine.

counterpulsation, mechanical ventilation, partial/total organ
resection, transient limb/organ ischemia-reperfusion, transfu-
sions, anesthetic agents, and the pharmacopoeia used in the
perioperative period (the perioperative exposome). This translates
into substantial interindividual variability in immediate adverse
perioperative events (mortality or incidence/severity of organ
dysfunction), recovery trajectories during a surgical patient jour-
ney, as well as long-term outcomes (i.e., phenotypes; Table 6-1).
For decades, we have attributed this variability only to a com-
bination of inherent patient factors that increase an individual’s
biologic susceptibility or reduce resilience to surgical trauma
(such as age, gender, frailty, cardiopulmonary fitness, nutritional
state, comorbidities)—what we colloquially call “protoplasm”—
or to heterogeneity in the intensity of exposure to perioperative
stressors. In recent years, we are increasingly appreciating that
genomic and epigenomic variation is also partially responsible for
this observed variability in patient vulnerability and outcomes.1
An individual’s susceptibility to adverse perioperative events and
critical illness stems not only from genomic contributions to the
development of comorbid risk factors (such as coronary artery
disease [CAD] or reduced preoperative cardiopulmonary reserve)
during their lifetime, but also from genomic variability in specific
biologic pathways participating in the host response to surgical
injury, heterogeneity of treatment effect,2 or in resilient responses
to trauma and stress (Fig. 6-1). With increasing evidence sug-
gesting that genomic and epigenomic regulation can significantly
modulate risk of adverse perioperative events by influencing the
host responses to surgery and trauma, host-device interactions,
host-allograft interactions, and host-tumor interactions,1,3,4 the
emerging field of perioperative genomics aims to apply functional
genomic approaches to uncover biologic mechanisms that explain
why similar patients have such dramatically different outcomes
after surgery, and is justified by a unique combination of expo-
sures to environmental insults and postoperative phenotypes that
characterize surgical trauma and critically ill patient populations.
Indeed, underlying perioperative genomics is the perioptome con-
cept,3 which highlights the intersection of an individual’s genome
with exposure to surgical stressors and anesthetics leading to a
set of phenotypic entities in that individual patient collectively
referred to as the perioperative phenome.
Traditional epidemiologic approaches have been limiting our
ability to examine factors contributing to such differential indi-
vidual susceptibility to adverse perioperative events, often hav-
ing to generalize from otherwise limited homogenous cohorts
to the effects on the overall population. However, it has become
apparent that heterogeneity in response to stressors at the indi-
vidual level tends to “stretch out” the population-level response
distribution curve, such that average treatment effects may not
be representative of the heterogeneity of individual treatment
effects (Fig. 6-1).2,6 Precision medicine (or in this case, precision
surgery, precision perioperative care, and precision critical care)7
is an emerging approach for disease prevention and treatment
that takes into account individual variability in genes, environ-
ment, preference, and lifestyle for each patient.8,9 Although not
new, this concept has been recently brought within our reach by
three converging opportunities: a rapid and significant expansion
of large-scale biologic databases (such as the reference human
genome, catalogs of human genetic variation, increased char-
acterization of genetic variant pathogenicity, RNA and protein
databases, curated biologic pathway databases, and expansion
of biobanks); powerful methods to characterize and monitor
patients (including the ability to conduct molecular profiles at
the genome, proteome, metabolome and microbiome levels, cel-
lular assays, multiparameter physiologic data streaming, mobile
health technologies, patient-activated social networks); and
refinement of computational tools for managing and analyzing
large datasets (“Big Data” analytics, machine learning, and aug-
mented intelligence).10 Spearheaded by a presidential Precision
Medicine Initiative, the National Institutes of Health launched
in 2016 the All of Us Research Program, which seeks to extend
precision medicine to all diseases by building a national research
cohort of more than 1 million participants reflecting the diver-
sity of the U.S. population, with commitment to protecting par"
ticipant privacy, regulatory modernization, and public-private
partnerships.11

Figure 6-1 The perioperative period represents a unique and extreme example of gene-environment interactions. Perioperative
adverse events are complex traits, characteristically involving an interaction between acute exposures to robust operative environmental perturba-
tions (surgical trauma, hemodynamic challenges, exposure to extracorporeal circulation, drug administration, nutritional challenges—the periopera-
tive exposome) occurring on a landscape of susceptibility determined by an individual's clinical and genetic characteristics (constitutive factors). The
observed variability in perioperative outcomes can be in part attributed to genetic and epigenetic variability modulating the dynamic host responses
to surgical injury. Adverse outcomes will develop only in patients whose combined burden of genetic and environmental risk factors exceeds a
certain threshold, which may vary with age. In fact, physiologic stress associated with life-threatening injury exposes genetic anomalies that might
otherwise go unnoticed. Identification of such genetic contributions not only to disease causation and susceptibility but also to the individual
patient's responses to disease and drug therapy, and incorporation of genetic risk information in clinical decision making, may lead to improved
health outcomes and reduced costs. However, some individuals are more sensitive than others to any given exposure to perioperative stressors,
making them more susceptible to develop adverse events. Heterogeneity in response at the individual level tends to "stretch out" the population-
level dose-response curve for any perioperative stress exposure. Under an emerging concept of physical resilience, the occurrence of perioperative
adverse events is further determined by the effectiveness of adaptive (hermetic) responses to perioperative stressors, which can mitigate injurious
systemic host responses. OR, operating room; CPB, cardiopulmonary bypass.
Several unique characteristics of the perioperative contin-
uum suggest that it may represent an ideal acute care paradigm
to implement precision medicine strategies. First, as a planned
event (for the most part), surgery allows for preemptive molecu-
lar or genomic profiling that can inform preoperative optimiza-
tion strategies. Second, the perioperative environment involves
intense perturbations and stressors that can unmask underlying
genetic susceptibilities. A third unique feature of the perioperative
setting is the dynamic decision-making process, which involves
multiple decision points over a relatively short period of time, sev-
eral medications amenable to pharmacogenomics-driven decision
support in order to improve their efficacy and safety, and a clini-
cal need for such guidance regarding patient-specific drug choices
and dosing (Fig. 6-2). Fourth, the acuity of the initial surgical
episode is similarly followed by a rapid convalescence period or a
short time to developing adverse events, thus allowing for rapid
assessment of clinical outcomes and interventions.1 Periopera-
tive physicians are generally familiar with risk prediction tools,
their implementation in clinical practice including incorporat-
ing interindividual variability into risk decisions, communicating
risks, and the intricacies of managing longitudinal care transitions
throughout the perioperative continuum. Finally, perioperative
health care delivery systems have been early adopters of electronic
health records (EHRs), with several large multi-institutional
data integration efforts like the Multicenter Perioperative Group
(www.mpogresearch.org) and the Anesthesiology Performance
Improvement and Reporting Exchange (www.aspirecqi.org) well
underway to enable perioperative medicine research, improve
adherence to evidence-based standards of care, and reduce vari-
ability in both clinical practice and in common adverse postopera-
tive outcomes, hospital length of stay, and cost.
Precision perioperative medicine aims to provide tailored
management and/or prevention of perioperative complications
according to the specific characteristics of a stratified individual,
subpopulation, or population to enhance care of surgical, criti-
cally ill, and injured patients. These characteristics are derived
from the integrated evaluation of phenotype, genotype, and
treatment bioresponses realized through a systems biomedicine
“ornics” approach.7 Decisions regarding preventive or therapeu-
tic interventions, informed by precision medicine molecular and
analytical approaches, would then be concentrated on patients
likely to benefit, sparing expense and side effects for those who

MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PHARMACOGENETIC-GUIDED INTERVENTIONS ALONG THE CONTINUUM OF PERIOPERATIVE CARE
Figure 6-2 Multiple opportunities exist for implementation of a set of actionable, accessible, and sustainable clinical decision support tools to
provide pharmacogenomics (PGx)-guided drug prescription along the continuum of perioperative care, under a new clinical paradigm to reduce
hospital length of stay and cost. POAF, postoperative atrial fibrillation; PB, beta-blocker; PACU, postanesthesia care unit; ICU, intensive care unit;

will not. Future implementation of perioperative precision medi-
cine is conceptually viewed as an automated feedback loop, rely-
ing on several interdependent cogs (precision science-precision
integration-precision delivery) to enable rapid acquisition, analy-
sis, and end-user delivery of stratified or personalized therapeu-
tic interventions.8 Adoption of this new generation of molecular
tests into clinical practice is predicated, however, on perioperative
physicians becoming increasingly familiar with several key con-
cepts, including patterns of human genome variation, gene regu-
lation, basic population genetic methodology, gene and protein
expression analysis, and most importantly the general principles
for evaluating biomarker performance, in addition to digital lit-
eracy. This chapter serves as a primer in genomic and precision
perioperative medicine by highlighting the evolving applications
of genomic technologies to refine perioperative risk stratifica-
tion, outcome prediction, understanding the complex biologic
mechanisms underlying responses to surgical stress and critical
illness, as well as identification and validation of novel targets for
perioperative organ protection.
Human Genomic Variation
In elucidating the genetic basis of disease, much of what has been
investigated in the pre-Human Genome Project era focused on
identifying rare genetic variants (mutations) responsible for more
than 1,500 monogenic disorders such as hypertrophic cardiomy-
opathy, long QT syndrome, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, or
familial hypercholesterolemia. However, most of the genetic diver-
sity in the population is attributable to more widespread DNA
sequence variations (.polymorphisms), typically single nucleotide
base substitutions (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs), or to
a broader category of structural genetic variants which include
short sequence repeats (microsatellites), insertion/deletion (I/D)
of one or more nucleotides (indels), inversions, and copy number
variants (CNVs, large segments of DNA that vary in number of
copies), all of which may or may not be associated with a specific
phenotype (Fig. 6-3). In addition to the nuclear genome, the mito-
chondrial genome encodes for 37 genes essential to mitochondrial
function. Variability in the mitochondrial DNA is implicated in a
growing number of diseases including neurodegenerative, myo-
pathic, cardiovascular, and metabolic conditions, with important
impheations for perioperative and critical care management.12
Twenty-two years since the release of the first draft of the human
genome, the publication of a truly complete gap-free sequence of
the human genome in 2022 by the Telomere-to-Telomere Consor-
tium revealed what has been missing.13 This complete assembly
corrected structural errors in the prior references, introducing
nearly 200 million base pairs of sequence containing biologically
important regions such as the centromeres (the constricted region
of a chromosome), including more than 1,900 new genes, 99 of
which are predicted to be protein coding, leading to improved
characterization of human genetic variation, which will better
support precision medicine, population genome analysis, evolu-
tionary biology, and genome editing. This effort will further be
complemented by the ongoing Human Pangenome Project, aim-
ing to catalog all-inclusive human genomic diversity by sequenc-
ing genomes of distinct populations from around the world.14 It
is also noteworthy that the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology and
Medicine was awarded for work on sequencing the genomes of
Neanderthals and Denisovans. About 1% to 4% of the genomes of
modem humans come from Neanderthals, information that is not
only relevant to understanding human evolution, but also disease
susceptibility such as risk of serious complications from contract-
ing COVID-19.15

Profiling/ Slhys Regulatory Genome to
Understand Perioperative Biology and
Biomarkers of Organ injury
and /adverse ©^teomes
Genomic approaches are anchored in the “central dogma” of
molecular biology, the concept of transcription of messenger RNA
(mRNA) from a DNA template, followed by translation of RNA
into protein (Fig. 6-4). Since transcription is a key regulatory
step that may eventually signal many other cascades of events,
the study of RNA abundance in a cell or organ (i.e., quantifying
gene expression) can improve the understanding of a wide variety
of biologic systems. Furthermore, although the human genome
contains only about 26,000 genes, functional variability at the
protein level is far more diverse, resulting from extensive post-
transcriptional and posttranslational modifications. It is believed
that there are approximately 200,000 distinct proteins in humans,
further subjected to a wide array of dynamic posttranslational
modifications (such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetyla-
tion, S-nitrosylation, carbonylation, SUMOylation, and disul-
fide structures, among others), which are implicated in protein
stability, coordinate protein-protein interactions, and serve key
regulatory functions. Increasing evidence suggests that variability
in gene expression levels underlies complex disease and is deter-
mined by regulatory DNA polymorphisms affecting transcription,
splicing, and translation efficiency in a tissue- and stimulus-
specific manner.18 Thus, in addition to the assessment of genetic
variability at the DNA sequence level (static genomics'), analysis of
large-scale variability in the pattern of RNA and protein expression
both at baseline and in response to exposure to the multidimen-
sional perioperative stimuli (dynamic genomics) using microarray,
next-generation sequencing (NGS), and proteomic approaches
provides a much needed understanding of the overall regulatory
networks involved in the pathophysiology of adverse postopera-
tive outcomes (Table 6-2). Such dynamic genomic markers can be
incorporated in genomic classifiers and used clinically to improve
perioperative risk stratification or monitor postoperative recovery,
including transplant rejection surveillance.7,19-21 An example of
To be classified as a polymorphism, the DNA sequence alterna-
tives (i.e., alleles) must exist with a frequency greater than 1% in
the population. About 15 million SNPs are estimated to exist in the
human genome, approximately once every 300 base pairs, located
in genes as well as in the surrounding regions of the genome. Poly-
morphisms may direcdy alter the amino acid sequence and therefore
potentially alter protein function or alter regulatory DNA sequences
that modulate protein expression. Sets of nearby SNPs on a chromo-
some are inherited in blocks, referred to as haplotypes. As it will be
shown later, haplotype analysis is a useful way of applying genotype
information in disease gene discovery. 'With increased identification
of novel sequence variants in the course of testing patient specimens
for a rapidly increasing number of genes associated with medical
conditions, the American College of Human Genetics and Genom-
ics (ACMG) has issued guidelines for evidence-based classifica-
tion of genetic variants for clinical interpretation into pathogenic,
benign, or variants of unknown significance.16 Furthermore, ACMG
has also assembled a list of 73 genes for which specific variants are
known to be causative of disorders with defined phenotypes that
are clinically actionable by an accepted intervention, including sev-
eral with direct impheations for perioperative medicine (malignant
hyperthermia, long QT syndrome, and other cardiovascular pheno-
types), along with guidance for reporting secondary findings in the
context of clinical exome and genome sequencing.17

molecular biology. Protein expression involves two main processes:
RNA synthesis (transcription) and protein synthesis (translation), with
many intermediate regulatory steps. A single gene can give rise to mul-
tiple protein products (isoforms) via processing of preRNA molecules
yielding multiple RNA products, including microRNA (miRNA) and small
interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, as well as alternative splicing and
RNA editing. Thus, functional variability at the protein level, ultimately
responsible for biologic effects, is the cumulative result of genetic vari-
ability as well as extensive transcriptional, posttranscriptional, transla-

using the interplay between static genomic and dynamic genomic
information for perioperative risk prediction in the case of
thoracic aortic disease follows. Although surgical repair of tho-
racic aortic aneurysms is typically recommended when the aor-
tic diameter reaches 5.0 to 5.5 cm, studies indicate that 60% of
aortic dissections occur at aortic diameters smaller than 5.5 cm.
However, DNA variants in specific genes (static genomics) can
not only distinguish patients at risk for thoracic aortic disease
but also predict the risk of early dissection at diameters smaller
than 5.0 cm, thus potentially personalizing the timing of aortic
surgery.22 Moreover, combined genomic and proteomic analysis
(dynamic genomics) using expression patterns of 138 genes from
peripheral blood leukocytes and levels of seven circulating plasma
proteins accurately discriminated patients who developed multi-
ple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) after thoracoabdominal
aortic aneurysm repair from those who did not. Importandy, these
genome-wide gene expression and plasma protein concentration
patterns were observed before surgical trauma and visceral isch-
emia-reperfusion injury, suggesting that patients who developed
MODS differed preoperatively in either their genetic predisposi-
tion or pre-existing inflammatory state.23
In addition to their applications for risk prediction, dynamic
genomic markers can improve mechanistic understanding of
perioperative stress, by evaluating and cataloging organ-specific
responses to surgical injury and severe systemic stimuli such as car-
diopulmonary bypass (CPB), ischemia-reperfusion, and endotox-
emia, which can be subsequendy used to subphenotype patients into
specific subgroups (endotypes) and identify and validate novel tar-
gets for organ protective or enhanced recovery strategies. This adds
to ongoing efforts to standardize surgical outcome assessments,24
including organ- and procedure-specific (e.g., transplantation)25
severity of complications. Individual endotypes of critical illness
syndromes or postoperative complications were identified using
classifiers developed using combinations of clinical and molecu-
lar markers,7 including COVID-19 viral sepsis endotypes (inflam-
mopathic, coagulopathic, or adaptive) 26 immunologic endotypes
after sepsis27 and trauma,28 as well as subphenotypes of delirium,29
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),30 and acute kidney
injury (AKI).31 We further illustrate such applications with sev-
eral examples from the perioperative period. Using an integrated
approach of transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of peripheral
blood, the molecular response signatures to cardiac surgery with
and without CPB have been characterized,32 offering novel insights
into the concepts of contact activation and compartmentalization of
inflammatory responses to major surgery. Although CPB has been
traditionally thought to be a robust trigger of systemic inflamma-
tion, similar systemic levels of key inflammatory mediators were
in fact seen following off-pump cardiac surgery, but with a delayed
onset. Rather than being the primary source of serum cytokines
as previously believed, peripheral blood leukocytes only assume
a primed phenotype upon contact with the extracorporeal circuit
which facilitates their trapping and subsequent tissue-associated
inflammatory response. Yet, other studies have identified genomic
differences in circulating blood leukocytes between patients devel-
oping postoperative neurocognitive decline33 or new-onset postop-
erative atrial fibrillation (AF).34 Using circulating blood cells as a
sentinel or reporter tissue is complemented by a large number of
reports describing gene expression changes directly in myocardial
tissue in response to acute ischemia, such as alterations in imme-
diate early genes (c-fos, junB), genes coding for calcium-handling
proteins (calsequestrin, phospholamban), extracellular matrix, and
cytoskeletal proteins in ischemic myocardium,35 as well as upregu-
lation of transcripts involved in cytoprotection (heat shock pro-
teins), resistance to apoptosis, and cell growth in areas of stunned
myocardium.36 Moreover, cardiac gene expression profiling after
CPB and cardioplegic arrest has identified age-related upregulation
of inflammatory and transcription activators, apoptosis, and stress
genes.37,38 Conversely, next-generation RNA sequencing of human
ventricular myocardium during cold cardioplegia-induced isch-
emia identified significant downregulation of immune inflamma-
tory and complement genes, and interesting targets in transcription
factors regulating reactive oxygen species production, apoptosis,
and inflammatory response.39 Whole-genome expression analysis
has also been utilized to study molecular changes associated with
myocardial preconditioning. The main functional categories of
genes identified as potentially involved in cardioprotective path-
ways include a host of transcription factors, heat shock proteins,
antioxidant genes (heme-oxygenase, glutathione peroxidase), and
growth factors, but different gene programs were found to be acti-
vated in ischemic versus anesthetic preconditioning, resulting in
two distinct molecular cardioprotective phenotypes.40 Notably,
transcriptional response pattern consistent with late precondition-
ing has been reported in peripheral blood leukocytes following
sevoflurane administration in healthy volunteers, characterized
by reduced expression of L-selectin as well as downregulation of
genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and the PCGla (peroxisome
activated receptor gamma coactivator la) pathway,41 which mir-
rors changes observed in the myocardium from patients undergo-
ing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (Table 6-2).42
Deregulation of these conserved survival pathways thus appears to
generalize across tissues, making them important targets for cardio-
protection, but further studies are needed to correlate periopera-
tive gene expression response patterns in end organs such as the
myocardium to those in readily available surrogate tissues such as
peripheral blood leukocytes.
A limitation of gene expression studies evaluating RNA abun-
dance like those described earlier is that changes in the tran-
scriptome (the complete collection of transcribed elements of the
genome) is not fully representative of the proteome (the comple-
ment of proteins encoded by the genome), since many transcripts
are not targeted for translation, as evidenced by the concept of
gene silencing by RNA interference. Alternative splicing, a wide
variety of posttranslational modifications, and protein-protein
interactions responsible for biologic function, would therefore
remain undetected by gene expression profiling (Fig. 6-4). This
has led to the emergence of proteomics, a field seeking to study the
sequence, abundance, modification, localization, and function of
proteins in a biologic system at a given time and in response to a
disease state, trauma, stress, or therapeutic intervention.43 Thus,
proteomics offers a more global and integrated view of biology,
complementing other functional genomic approaches. Several
proteomic studies relevant to perioperative medicine have char-
acterized the temporal changes in brain protein expression in
response to various inhaled anesthetics,44,45 following experi-
mental cardiac surgery with hypothermic circulatory arrest,46
or in serum proteins associated with postoperative delirium.47
This may focus further studies aimed to identify new anesthetic
binding sites, and the development of neuroprotective strategies.
The natural cardioprotective adaptations invoked by mammalian
hibemators to cope with ischemia-reperfusion injury have been
characterized using comparative proteomic approaches, and
involve extensive metabolic remodeling with increased expres-
sion of fatty acid metabolic proteins and reduced levels of toxic
lipid metabolites, offering insights into novel strategies for meta-
bolic optimization as a transformative approach for periopera-
tive organ protection.48 Recently, combined transcriptomic and
proteomic profiling was used to understand host-device inter-
actions, identifying a signature of transcripts and phosphopep-
tides in left ventricular tissue from patients with advanced heart
failure receiving left ventricular assist device (LVAD) that was
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
unique to the patients with complete and sustained ventricular
recovery following mechanical circulatory support (i.e., respond-
ers) compared to nonresponders.49 By providing insight into
the underlying biologic mechanisms for recovery in responders,
these findings could guide patient selection for LVAD support
and help identify new pharmacologic therapies for heart failure.
Finally, detailed knowledge of the plasma proteome has profound
implications in perioperative transfusion medicine, in particular
related to peptide and protein changes that occur during blood
product storage.50
Unique metabolic phenotypes characterize individual patients,
reflecting a composite readout of host genetic-controlled meta-
bolic processes, diet and lifestyle responses, and microbial activity.
Nowhere is this more important than in surgery, where the meta-
bolic phenotype is modified by anesthetic drugs, neoadjuvant
therapies, microbial contamination and decontamination, peri-
operative nutritional strategies, heterogeneous pathologies, and
varying surgical techniques, approaches, and hospital environ-
ments. 52 Because metabolic phenotypes can be measured
from the composition of accessible biofluids, gases, and tissues
sampled longitudinally in the perioperative course, applications
spanning from population-based disease risk studies for surgical
conditions to precision health care and surgical stratification have
been proposed.52,53 Nicholson et al. have proposed the concept
of “phenotypically augmented patient journey,” in which longi-
tudinal or dynamic metabolic phenotyping (the metabolic tra-
jectory) enables improved diagnosis, stratification, optimization
(including enhanced recovery protocols), and outcome predic-
tion by mapping and monitoring a patient’s response to a thera-
peutic intervention.52 Deviations from the recovery trajectory can
occur at any point in the patient journey, at which point biologic
samples can be obtained again to refine assessment of differential
diagnosis, therapeutic responses, and long-term outcome predic-
tion. Emerging metabolomic tools have created the opportunity to
establish metabolic signatures of tissue injury. Biofluids such as
plasma or urine represent snapshots of a patient’s metabolic state
and reflect biochemical processes occurring in multiple organs
and tissues. In a population of patients undergoing alcohol septal
ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, a human
model of planned myocardial infarction (MI), targeted mass spec-
trometry-based metabolite profiling identified changes in circulat-
ing levels of metabolites participating in pyrimidine metabolism,
the TCA cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway as early as
10 minutes after MI in an initial derivation group and were vali-
dated in a second, independent group. Coronary sinus sampling
distinguished cardiac derived from peripheral metabolic changes.
To assess generalizability, the planned Ml-derived metabolic
signature (consisting of aconitic acid, hypoxanthine, trimethyl-
amine N-oxide, and threonine) differentiated with high-accuracy
patients with spontaneous Ml.54 We applied a similar approach to
cardiac surgical patients undergoing planned global myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion, and identified clear differences in metabolic
fuel uptake based on the pre-existing ventricular state (left ven-
tricular dysfunction, CAD, or neither) as well as altered metabolic
signatures predictive of postoperative hemodynamic course and
perioperative Ml.55 Although simultaneous assessment of coro-
nary sinus effluent in addition to the peripheral blood improves
cardiac specificity of the observed signatures, complementary
measurements of metabolites directly in myocardial tissue allow
marked enrichment and easier detection of potential biomarkers
compared to plasma, as well as mechanistic insight by assess-
ing how metabolic substrates are utilized in the tissue of inter-
est. Such studies are possible in cardiac surgical patients where
atrial tissues are routinely removed; for example, one study using
high-resolution *H-NMR spectroscopy identified alterations in
myocardial ketone metabolism associated with persistent AF, and
the ratio of glycolytic to lipid metabolism end products correlated
positively with time of onset of postoperative AE56 Applications of
metabolic phenotyping for surgical outcome prediction have been
reported for cardiac surgery,57 abdominal organ transplantation,58
and major trauma,59 with specific prognostic signatures for criti-
cal illness outcomes60 including prediction of intensive care unit
(ICU) length of stay.61 Bariatric surgery represents the model for
studying surgical metabolism, however, where metabolic profil-
ing has been reported to predict long-term response to different
procedures both in terms of weight loss and remission of type 2
diabetes.62 Potentially complementing metabolic phenotyping,
prediction of weight loss after bariatric surgery is also improved
using body mass index-associated polygenic risk scores (PRS)
in a cost-effective manner, suggesting that genetic testing could
be used in the preoperative assessment of patients with severe
obesity.63 However, clinical implementation is still limited by lack
of standardization of both study design and analytic approaches.64
Furthermore, a new paradigm for using phannacometabonomics
has been proposed, which involves longitudinal and dynamic
measurement of an individual’s metabolic profiles prior to, dur-
ing, and after a therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery; periopera-
tive drug administration, nutritional support) in order to stratify
patients and predict response to future treatments or likelihood of
adverse events.52,65 This will be discussed further in the Pharma-
cogenomics and Anesthesia section.
Integration of multiple static and dynamic “omic” profiles
through multiomics analysis approaches can connect functional
layers to improve prediction, understanding of complex mecha-
nisms, and biomarker identification. Here, we briefly summa-
rize this approach to study innate and adaptive immune host
responses to surgery, which play key roles in the pathogenesis of
perioperative organ injury and dysfunction. This was facilitated by
recent advances in single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic tech-
nologies, enabling a comprehensive characterization of human
immune response to surgery for both predictive and mechanistic
understanding.66 Previously, comprehensive immune monitoring
via flow cytometry (exact quantification of surface marker expres-
sion on blood immune cells) was used in combination with cyto-
kine determination for outcome prediction. Monocytic HLA-DR
surface expression and plasma IL-10 were the best predictors of
infection risk after cardiac surgery,67 whereas surface expression
of CD99 and CD47 (markers of neutrophil migratory responses)
predict AKI and, when combined with the EuroSCORE, improve
prediction of postoperative ICU length of stay after cardiac sur-
gery.68 More recently, high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry
applied to longitudinally collected blood samples identified a uni-
form surgical immune signature and also correlated with surgical
recovery trajectories in patients undergoing hip replacement.69
Importantly, a patient-specific “immune phenotype” assessed in
samples obtained preoperatively and stimulated exogenously in
vitro with lipopolysaccharide and other inflammatory ligands
predicted postoperative individual recovery across patient-
centered domains like pain, dysfunction, and disability.70 This
presurgical immune signature, involving toll-like receptor 4 sig-
naling responses in CD14 monocytes, offers a new paradigm and
potentially actionable insight for manipulating the speed of post-
operative recovery. Integrated single-cell mass cytometry and pro-
teomic analyses conducted on samples collected perioperatively
identified specific systemic immune signatures preceding the
development of surgical site complications in patients undergoing
noncancer bowel resection.71 Moreover, a similar mass cytometry
systems immunology approach was used to identify a specific
immune signature in immature neutrophils differentiating sep-
sis severity from aseptic inflammatory responses associated with
6 Genomic Basis of Perioperative Precision Medicine
cardiac surgery, an old clinical dilemma in sepsis diagnosis tim-
ing and accuracy.72 Given the complexity of the host responses to
surgery and critical illness, such multiomic approaches can pro-
vide insight into whether a derangement in biomarker level may
be epiphenomenal rather than integral to a causative pathway, or
may even be part of an adaptive pathway.73
Ep/genet/cs: The Linik between
Environment ansi Genes
In response to outside stimuli, the genome can undergo poten-
tially heritable alterations that can substantially affect gene
expression and regulation without altering the DNA sequence—
hence termed epigenetic. Whereas DNA is the blueprint, epigen-
etic information provides the instruction for using that blueprint.
The epigenetic code—consisting of DNA-based modifications
(e.g., DNA methylation), post-translational modifications of his-
tone proteins (e.g., acetylation), and a growing array of noncod-
ing RNAs (e.g., micro-RNA)—is responsive to the environment,
differs between cell types, and is susceptible to change, thus
representing an excellent target to impact health outcomes.
Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that epigen-
etic mechanisms can explain susceptibility to acute and chronic
pain, making them potential therapeutic targets. Specific epi-
genetic mechanisms relevant to perioperative analgesia involve
the developmental expression of opioid receptors and opioid-
induced hyperalgesia. In general, opiates tend to increase global
DNA methylation levels, whereas local anesthetics conversely
have a demethylating effect. This local anesthetic effect may have
potential in the development of chronic pain and perioperative
cancer medicine.'4 Furthermore, important pathophysiologic
processes relevant to the perioperative period like stress-induced
proinflammatory responses are regulated by epigenetic factors
such as histone acetylation. Again, lidocaine has been shown to
both demethylate DNA and have strong anti-inflammatory prop-
erties, but a direct epigenetic link has not yet been investigated.
Finally, the ability of noncoding RNAs to mediate important
organ protective phenomena like anesthetic preconditioning has
recently been reported.75
Recendy, circulating cell-free nucleic acids have been increas-
ingly recognized as epigenetic plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has
been increasingly recognized as epigenetic biomarkers in preci-
sion medicine. They are a mixture of single- or double-standed
nucleic acids, released into the blood plasma by different tissues
via necrosis, apoptosis, and secretions. These include DNA, RNA,
microRNA (miRNA), long noncoding RNA (IncRNA), fetal DNA/
RNA, and mitochondrial DNA/RNA, which act as potential bio-
markers in various clinical conditions. 76 In particular, several
studies have characterized total cfDNA levels as a sensitive acute-
phase biomarker for surgical damage or severity of injury, includ-
ing following penetrating trauma and surgery.77,78 Of note, while
changes in cfDNA levels differed with magnitude of surgery, no
correlations were found with conventional markers of surgical
damage, including surgical time, estimated blood loss, postopera-
tive white blood count, or postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP)
level. In surgical oncology, perioperative changes in cfDNA con-
centrations were associated with surgical complications and tumor
recurrence following curative resection for colon and other gastro-
intestinal cancers,79 and nonmetastatic breast cancer.80 In cardiac
surgery, cfDNA predicted development of late AKI in adults81 and
mortality in infants.82 But the most robust application of cfDNA
is in transplant surgery, for surveillance of allograft injury, dys-
function, and rejection. In this case, donor-derived cell-free DNA
(ddcfDNA) can be assayed in a transplant recipient’s blood without
the need for donor or recipient genotyping. The key incremen-
tal value of ddcfDNA over peripheral gene expression testing in
cardiac transplantation is its ability to detect and distinguish both
acute cellular rejection and antibody-mediated rejection, in addi-
tion to identifying graft dysfunction, a true “liquid biopsy.”20,83
Similar performance reports exist for lung,84 liver, and kidney
allograft surveillance.85 Remaining challenges include validating
the threshold values for clinical use and their roles in differentiat-
ing alternative (nonrejection) forms of allograft injury.
Next, we review the common genomic strategies used to study
disease and drug responses.
Overview/ of Genetic Epidemiology
and functional Genomic Methodology
Most ongoing research on complex disorders focuses on identify-
ing genetic variants that modify susceptibility to given conditions
or drug responses. Often the design of such studies is compli-
cated by the presence of multiple risk factors, gene-environment
interactions, and a lack of even rough estimates of the number of
genes underlying such complex traits. Genetic association studies
examine the frequency of specific genetic or epigenetic variants in
a population-based sample of unrelated diseased individuals and
appropriately matched unaffected controls. The nature of most
complex diseases in general, and perioperative adverse outcomes
in particular (surgical patients are typically elderly), makes the
study of extended multigenerational family pedigrees impractical
(with few exceptions, e.g., malignant hyperthermia), due to the
lack of availability of pedigree information and/or DNA samples.
Even a detailed family history, the first tool in the genomic tool-
box, is seldom available for most categories of adverse periop-
erative events. Feasibility without requiring family-based sample
collections, and the increased statistical power to uncover small
clinical effects of multiple genes constitute the main advantages of
the genetic association approach over traditional linkage analysis
methodology.
Two broad strategies have been employed to identify com-
plex trait loci through association analysis. The candidate gene
approach is motivated by what is known about the trait biologi-
cally, with genes selected because of a priori hypotheses about
their potential etiologic role in disease based on current under-
standing of the disease pathophysiology,86 and can be character-
ized as a hypothesis-testing approach but is intrinsically biased.
In the early stages of perioperative genomics, most significant
results were gathered from candidate gene association studies. As
it will be presented in more detail later, this includes most pub-
lished reports on specific genotypes associated with a variety of
organ-specific perioperative adverse outcomes, including MI,87,88
neurocognitive dysfunction,89-91 renal compromise,92-94 vein graft
restenosis,95,96 postoperative thrombosis,97 vascular reactivity and
vasoplegia,98,99 severe sepsis,100 transplant rejection,101 and death
(for reviews, see references 1 and 102).
The second strategy is the genome-wide scan, in which thou-
sands of markers uniformly distributed throughout the genome
or epigenome are used to locate regions that may harbor genes or
regulatory regions influencing phenotypic variability. Examples
include genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or epigenome-
wide association studies (EWAS), as well as NGS technologies
involving whole-exome sequencing (all the protein-coding genes
in a genome) or whole-genome sequencing. These are unbiased
approaches, in the sense that no prior assumptions are being
made about the biologic processes involved and no weight is
given to known genes, thus allowing the detection of previously
unknown trait loci. Within the past decades, an explosion of
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
adequately powered and successfully replicated GWAS has iden-
tified very significant genetic contributors to risk for common
polygenic diseases like CAD,103 MI,104 heart failure,10 diabetes
(type I and II),106’107 AF,108 obesity, blood pressure,109 asthma,
common cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and oth-
ers. In the last decade, the GWAS methodology has also been
extended to study key perioperative adverse outcomes like MI,110
AF,111 ventricular dysfunction,112 and AKI.113 Although the ability
to predict disease remains limited, the newly discovered genetic
associations have provided insight into unsuspected mechanisms
for disease, many of them located in known drug targets. These
studies were facilitated by the completion of several key exten-
sions of the Human Genome Project—the International HapMap
Project (a high-resolution map of human genetic variation and
haplotypes),114 the 1,000 Genomes Project (an initial catalog of
human genetic variation across ethnically diverse populations),11’
the 100,000 Genomes Project,116 and the Encyclopedia of DNA
Elements (ENCODE, a map of functional elements in the human
genome, their tissue distribution, and their roles in affecting gene
function and regulation)117—coupled with advances in high-
throughput genotyping technologies. At the time of this publi-
cation, the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog (www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas)
included approximately 6,000 publications and 400,000 poly-
morphisms-trait associations, with the list growing every day.118
Several important themes have emerged from GWAS. First, most
SNPs associated with common diseases collectively explain only
a small proportion of the observed contribution of heredity to the
risk of disease (e.g., 6% for type 2 diabetes), or other complex
traits (e.g., 2% for body mass index and 5% for height). This “miss-
ing heritability” problem is in part explained by the underlying
rationale for GWAS—the “Common Disease-Common Variant”
hypothesis—postulating that common diseases may arise second-
ary to cumulative effects of common variants. Most genes, how-
ever, lack a common functional coding variant with a detectable
functional effect, yet they typically contain several rare variants.
A counterhypothesis has emerged stating that there are additional
novel genes harboring such low-frequency variants (possibly with
larger effects) that may be the primary drivers of common dis-
ease. Currently, these variants are poorly detected by genotyping
microarrays, but with the advent of next-generation sequencing
technologies, the potential exists to revolutionize complex traits
genetics by identifying and typing rare variants and thus render-
ing virtually every gene susceptible for genetic analysis. Neverthe-
less, GWAS results also underscored that small genetic effect sizes
do not necessarily translate into limited therapeutic effectiveness
of intervening in the respective biologic pathways. Case in point,
although the risk variant in HMG CoA reductase was associated
in GWAS with only 2.3 mg/dL variability in low density lipoproten
(LDL) cholesterol,19 up to 60% reductions in LDL levels can be
achieved by intervening in the LDL metabolic pathway. Second,
more than two-thirds of the variants identified so far are located
either in intergenic regions or in genes of unknown function. This,
among other findings, has challenged the very concept of “gene”
as the traditional unit of heredity. Instead of directly driving dis-
ease and complex phenotypes, many genetic variants regulate the
activity of genes, influencing how much RNA is being transcribed
and ultimately how much protein is being produced. Pinpointing
these regulatory regions, known as expression quantitative trait
loci (eQTL), enables better understanding of genetic drivers of
disease risk. A recent seminal study has systematically cataloged
regulatory gene locations adjacent to a gene of interest (known
as ds-eQTL), as well as regions more distant to the gene or on
another chromosome (known as trans-eQTL), which exerted
strong influence on gene expression primarily through regulation
of transcription factors.120 This is the mechanistic underpinning
the use of PRS to summarize genome-wide combined risk for a
complex disease into a single metric that can be used to stratify
individuals,121,122 which will be further discussed in subsequent
sections. Discovery of the diverse and ubiquitous roles of new
classes of RNA (including microRNAs and short interfering RNAs)
led to an emerging picture of gene regulation as interdependent
layers of control consisting of interactions of DNA with regula-
tory proteins and RNA (Fig. 6-4).123 Moreover, as discussed ear-
lier, on top of the DNA sequence lays another (epigenetic) code,
that influences when and what genes should be transcribed or
silenced. The epigenome is laid down during pre- and postnatal
development and is heritable through cell divisions.
One of the main weaknesses of the genetic association approach
is that, unless the marker of interest “travels” (i.e., is in linkage dis-
equilibrium) with a functional variant, or the marker allele is the
actual functional (causal) variant, the power to detect and map
complex trait loci will be reduced. Newer (“next-generation”)
approaches based on direct whole-genome sequencing depart from
the concept of linkage by attempting to directly identify causal
alleles.124 One particular application of genome-scale sequencing is
whole-exome sequencing. The exome, defined as the protein-coding
portion of the genome, is comprised in humans of approximately
30 megabases (1%) split among approximately 200,000 exons.
Aside from the ability to identify rare variants and the obvious sub-
stantial cost reduction (~ 20-fold), this approach has the advantage
of focusing on nonsynonymous variants in coding genes for which
there are well-established methods of functional validation and
interpretation of biologic effects, thus enabling their implication
as causal variants. However, it completely misses noncoding and
structural variation in the genome. Early results suggest that whole-
exome sequencing is an effective approach to identify causal muta-
tions for monogenic disorders but also to distinguish signal (causal
rare variants) from noise (background rate of rare mutations) for
complex traits. Successful studies so far (e.g., early-onset MI)
sequenced individuals informed by the following key observations:
the younger the age when developing MI, the greater the heritabil-
ity; selecting extremes of the phenotype distribution (e.g., young
with MI vs. old without MI as a “hypemormal” control group) is
likely to improve power, under the scientific rationale that phe-
notypic extremes are enriched for either deleterious or protective
variants125; and that genetic discovery may be enhanced by study-
ing multiple ethnicities. These studies have demanded the develop-
ment of novel statistical methods to associate rare variants with the
phenotype. One such promising solution for overcoming the statis-
tical challenges revolving around sequencing low-frequency vari-
ants is to combine all nonsynonymous SNPs (by gene or biologic
pathway) into a single statistical test. The first integrated analysis of
a complete human genome in a clinical context, in a patient with a
family history of vascular disease and early sudden death has been
reported in 2010.126 The analysis revealed increased genetic risk for
CAD, MI, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers, as well as rare vari-
ants in three genes clinically associated with sudden cardiac death.
Furthermore, the patient had variants associated with clopidogrel
resistance, a positive response to lipid-lowering therapies, and a
low initial dosing requirement for warfarin, suggesting that routine
whole-genome sequencing can yield clinically relevant informa-
tion for individual patients. Several additional advantages of next-
generation technologies involve sequencing of multiple genomes
per person, such as matched tumor and blood DNA samples from
20 common types of cancer in the Cancer Genome Atlas, which
enable development of targeted therapeutics based on a detailed
molecular understanding of pathogenesis and host-tumor interac-
tions. Equally important for medical progress is the sequencing of
genomes of the billions of microorganisms that dwell within us as
part of the Human Microbiome Project.
6 Genomic Basis of Perioperative Precision Medicine

Other known limitations of genetic association studies include
potential false positive findings resulting from population stratifi-
cation (i.e., admixture of different ethnic or genetic backgrounds
in the case and control groups), and multiple comparison issues
when large numbers of genes or variants are being assessed.127
Replication of findings across different populations or related
phenotypes remains the most reliable method of validating a true
relationship between genetic polymorphisms and disease, but
poor reproducibility in subsequent studies has been one of the
main criticisms of the candidate gene association approach.128
Therefore, it is particularly important to follow initial association
analysis results with functional analyses using in silico, in vitro,
and in vivo experiments aimed at identifying the causal genetic
variants, causal epigenetics, and affected biologic pathways.
Translation of genomic findings to the clinic ultimately
revolves around either new disease mechanisms (better disease
definition or disease stratification) or new therapeutic strategies
(new targets, drug repurposing, or drug response stratification).
A particular focus of recent efforts to translate genome sequence
information into clinical decision making revolves around the
“actionability” of specific genetic variants, and the level of evi-
dence required to establish whether a variant is actionable. In the
context of incidental findings or in an asymptomatic individual,
clinical actionability represents the degree to which an interven-
tion exists that can mitigate harm before a clinical diagnosis is
made. Related terms are clinical validity, the accuracy and reliabil-
ity of a variant in identifying or predicting an event with biologic
or medical significance in an asymptomatic individual, and clini-
cal utility, the usefulness of information in clinical decision mak-
ing and improving health outcomes.129 The National Institutes of
Health has created the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) to
serve as an authoritative public portal defining the clinical rel-
evance of genomic variants for use in precision medicine (www.
clinicalgenome.org).130 Several applications to perioperative med-
icine are presented in the following sections.
Genomics and Perioperative
Risk Profiling
1 More than 40 million patients undergo surgery annually in the
United States at a cost of $450 billion. This global burden of
surgery131 continues to challenge society with a large corpus
of unmet medical needs. Each year, approximately 1 million
patients sustain medical complications after surgery, resulting in
costs of $25 billion annually. The proportion of the U.S. popu-
lation above 65 years of age is estimated to double in the next
two decades, adding multimorbidity to the world of surgery and
critical care132 and leading to a 25% increase in the number of
surgeries, a 50% increase in surgery-related costs, and a 100%
increase in complications from surgery. Although many preop-
erative predictors have been identified and are constantly being
refined, risk stratification based on clinical, procedural, and bio-
logic markers explains only a small part of the variability in the
incidence of perioperative complications. As mentioned earlier, it
is becoming increasingly recognized that perioperative morbid-
ity arises as a direct result of the environmental stress of surgery
occurring on a landscape of susceptibility that is determined by
an individual’s clinical and genetic characteristics, and may even
occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Such adverse outcomes
will develop only in patients whose combined burden of genetic
and environmental risk factors exceeds a certain threshold,
which may vary with age. Identification of such genetic contri-
butions not only to disease causation and susceptibility but also
to the response to disease and drug therapy, and incorporation of
genetic risk information in clinical decision making, may lead
to improved health outcomes and reduced costs. For instance,
understanding the role of genetic variation in proinflammatory
and pro thrombotic pathways (thromboinflammation), the main
pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for perioperative com-
plications, may contribute to the development of target-specific
therapies, thereby limiting the incidence of adverse events in
high-risk patients. Genomic variability has not only been iden-
tified in the host responses to surgery and trauma, but also in
host-device interactions, host-allograft interactions, and host-
tumor interactions, all with a potential to impact the surgical
patient journey. To increase clinical relevance for the practicing
perioperative physician, we summarize next existing evidence by
specific outcome while highlighting candidate genes in relevant
mechanistic pathways (Tables 6-3 through 6-5).
Predictive Biomarkers for Perioperative
Adverse 'Cstrdssic Events
Perioperative Myocardial Infarction and
Ventricular Dysfunction
Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease can be at
increased risk for perioperative cardiac complications. Over the
last few decades, several multifactorial risk indices have been
developed and validated for both noncardiac (e.g., Lee’s revised
cardiac risk index [RCRI]) and cardiac surgical patients (e.g.,
Hannan scores), with the specific aim of stratifying risk for peri-
operative adverse events. However, these multifactorial risk indi-
ces have only limited predictive value for identifying patients at
the highest risk of postoperative MI (PMI).133 In this context, it
has been proposed that genomic approaches could aid in refin-
ing an individuars risk profile. The incidence of PMI following
cardiovascular surgery remains between 7% and 19%,134 despite
advances in surgical, cardioprotective, and anesthetic techniques,
and is consistently associated with reduced short- and long-term
survival in these patients. The pathophysiology of PMI after car-
diac surgery involves systemic and local inflammation, “vulner-
able” blood, and neuroendocrine stress.1 In noncardiac surgery,
PMI occurs as a result of two distinct mechanisms: (1) coronary
plaque rupture and subsequent thrombosis triggered by a number
of perioperative stressors including catecholamine surges, proin-
flammatory, and prothrombotic states; and (2) myocardial oxygen
supply-demand imbalance.135 Interindividual genetic variability
in these mechanistic pathways is extensive, which may combine
in any given patient to modulate overall susceptibility to periop-
erative stress and ultimately the magnitude of myocardial injury.
Nevertheless, until recendy, only a few studies have explored the
role of genetic factors in the development of PMI,95,136’137 mainly
conducted in patients undergoing GABG surgery (Table 6-3).
Inflammation biomarkers and perioperative adverse cardiac
events. Although the role of inflammation in cardiovascular dis-
ease biology has long been established, we are just beginning to
understand the relationship between genetically controlled vari-
ability in inflammatory responses to surgery and PMI pathogen-
esis. Several studies reported independent predictive value for
incident PMI after cardiac surgery with CPB of polymorphisms in
proinflammatory genes interleukin-6 (IL6), intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM1), and E-selectin (SELF),87 or a combined hap-
lotype in the mannose-binding lectin gene (MBL2 LYQA secretor
haplotype), an important recognition molecule in the comple-
ment pathway.88 Similarly, genetic variants in IL6 and TNFA have
also been described in association with increased incidence of
postoperative cardiovascular complications including PMI after
lung surgery for cancer.138 Several polymorphisms in key proin-
flammatory genes have been associated with robust increases in

perioperative inflammatory responses in patients undergoing car-
diac surgery with CPB. These include the promoter SNPs in IL6
(-572G>C and -174G>C),°9 also shown to prolong the hospital
length of stay140; the apolipoprotein E genotype (the e4 allele)141;
SNPs in the tumor necrosis factor genes (TNFA-308G>A and
-863 C>A, LTA+250G>A),142,143 further associated with postop-
erative left ventricular dysfunction144; and a functional genetic
variant in macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)145 and
toll-like receptor 4.146 Conversely, a genetic variant is modulat-
ing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10
(IL10-1082G>A) in response to CPB, with high levels of IL10
surprisingly being associated with postoperative cardiovascular
dysfunction.147,148 In patients undergoing elective surgical revas-
cularization for peripheral vascular disease, several SNPs in IL6
(-174 G>C, nt565 G>A) and 1L10 (-1082 G>A, -819 OT, -592
C>A, and the ATA haplotype) were associated with endothelial
dysfunction and an increased risk of a composite endpoint of
acute postoperative cardiovascular events.149
CRP is the prototypical acute-phase reactant and the most
extensively studied inflammatory marker in clinical studies, and
high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) has emerged as a robust predic-
tor of cardiovascular risk at all stages, from healthy subjects to
patients with acute coronary syndromes and acute decompen-
sated heart failure.150 Whether CRP is merely a marker or also
a mediator of inflammatory processes is yet unclear, but sev-
eral lines of evidence support the latter theory. In perioperative
medicine, elevated preoperative CRP levels have been associated
with increased short- and long-term morbidity and mortality in
patients undergoing primary elective CABG (cutoff >3 mg/L)151
as well as in higher-acuity CABG patients (cutoff >10 mg/L).152
Interestingly, in a retrospective analysis of patients with elevated
baseline hs-CRP levels undergoing off-pump CABG surgery, pre-
operative statin therapy was associated with reduced postopera-
tive myocardial injury and need for dialysis.153 In elective major
noncardiac surgery patients, preoperative CRP levels (cutoff
>3.4 mg/L) independently predicted perioperative major car-
diovascular events (composite of MI, pulmonary edema, cardio-
vascular death) and significantly improved the predictive power
of RCRI in receiver operating characteristic analysis.154 While
baseline plasma CRP levels have an estimated heritability around
50%,155 intriguingly the acute-phase rise in postoperative plasma
CRP levels is also genetically determined. The CRP1059G>C
polymorphism was associated with lower peak postoperative
serum CRP following both elective CABG with CPB,156 as well
as esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer.157 Further-
more, CRP-717 C>T polymorphism was associated with stress
hyperglycemia in patients undergoing esophagectomy for can-
cer, leading to increased postoperative infectious complications
and 1CU length of stay.158 Using PRS methodology, it is possible
to index an individual’s genetic susceptibility to systemic inflam-
mation. A calculated PRS for CRP level based on genome-wide
meta-analysis results from the CHARGE Consortium159 was dif-
ferentially associated with response to antidepressant drugs.160
Bolstered by breakthroughs in the scale of GWAS and accessi-
bility to large biobank datasets, additional studies have focused
on the clinical utility and remaining challenges for PRS in pre-
dicting inflammatory diseases and evaluating putative causal
relationships with magnitude of inflammatory responses.161
A clinical-PRS model including 11 clinical risk factors and 7
SNPs was trained and validated to predict severe COVID-19,162
whereas another 6 SNP PRS were independently associated with
severe COVID-19 and improved predictions of both risk of hos-
pitalization and risk of severe disease.163
The COVID-19 pandemic brought cytokine storm syndrome
back to the forefront, with increased understanding of its immu-
nopathology, genetic determinism, and importantly therapeutic
targeting.1 1 6 The central role played by IL6 in this immune
hyperactivation condition has prompted targeted immunomod-
ulatory treatment with anti-IL6 receptor monoclonal antibody
(tocilizumab) in patients with severe COVID-19,167,168 which

demonstrated increased efficacy in patients’ high baseline IL6
levels and highlighted the challenges of refining a window of
therapeutic opportunity. Given that significant cytokine release
can complicate cardiac surgery, and absent proven benefits of
routine administration of corticosteroids, the clinical utility of
targeted anticytokine therapies (pharmacologic, hemoadsorb-
tion) in at-risk cardiac surgical patients (infective endocarditis,
genetic susceptibility for exaggerated inflammatory response)
should be reappraised as a perioperative precision medicine
strategy.169
Hemostatic biomarkers and perioperative adverse cardiac
events. The host response to surgery is also characterized by
alterations in the coagulation system, manifested as increased
fibrinogen concentration, platelet adhesiveness, and plasmino-
gen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) production. These changes can
be more pronounced after cardiac surgery, where the complex
and multifactorial effects of hypothermia, hemodilution, and
CPB-induced activation of coagulation, fibrinolytic, and inflam-
matory pathways are combined. Dysfunction of the coagulation
system following cardiac surgery may manifest on a continuum
ranging from increased thrombotic complications such as coro-
nary graft thrombosis, PMI, stroke, and pulmonary embolism
at one end of the spectrum, to excessive bleeding as the other
extreme. The balance between normal hemostasis, bleeding, and
thrombosis is markedly influenced by the rate of thrombin for-
mation and platelet activation, with genetic variability known
to modulate each of these mechanistic pathways,170 suggesting
significant heritability of the prothrombotic state (see Table 6-5
for an overview of genetic variants associated with postoperative
bleeding). Several genotypes in hemostatic genes have been asso-
ciated with increased risk of coronary graft thrombosis and myo-
cardial injury following CABG. A genetic variant in the promoter
of the PAH gene, consisting of an insertion (5G)/deletion (4G)
polymorphism, has been associated with changes in the plasma
levels of PAI-1. Since PAI-1 is an important negative regulator of
fibrinolytic activity, its polymorphism has been associated with
increased risk of early graft thrombosis after CABG,171 and in a
meta-analysis, with increased incidence of MI.172 Functional
genetic variants regulating platelet activation have also been
associated with adverse postoperative outcomes. These include
a polymorphism in the platelet glycoprotein Illa gene (ITGB3),
resulting in increased platelet aggregation (Pl^ polymorphism),
associated with increased perioperative myocardial injury,173 risk
of thrombotic coronary graft occlusion, MI, and 1-year mortal-
ity,174 as well as a variant in the protease-activated receptor-4
(PAR4) gene associated with PMI after CABG.175 Advanced heart
failure patients requiring ventricular mechanical support rep-
resent a unique population that might benefit from a thorough
preoperative risk profiling, given that implantation of ventricular
assist devices can unmask previously undiagnosed thrombophilia.
In the setting of noncardiac surgery, two polymorphisms in plate-
let glycoprotein receptors (ITGB3 and GPI BA) have been shown
to be independent risk predictors of PMI in patients undergoing
major vascular surgery, and resulted in improved discrimination
of an ischemia risk assessment tool when added to historic and
procedural risk factors.176 Finally, a point mutation in coagulation
factor V (1691G>A) resulting in resistance to activated protein C
(factor V Leiden) was also associated with various postoperative
thrombotic complications following noncardiac surgery.97 Con-
versely, in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, factor V Leiden
was associated with significant reductions in postoperative blood
loss and overall risk of transfusion.177 Nevertheless, in a prospec-
tive study of CABG patients with routine 3-month postoperative
angiographic follow-up, carriers of factor V Leiden had a higher
incidence of graft occlusion.178
Natriuretic peptides and perioperative adverse cardiac events. Cir- I 2
culating B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a powerful biomarker
of cardiovascular outcomes in many circumstances. Produced
mainly in the ventricular myocardium, BNP is formed by cleavage
of its prohormone by the enzyme corin into the biologically active
C-terminal fragment (BNP), and an inactive N-terminal frag-
ment (NT-proBNP). Known stimuli of BNP activation are myo-
cardial mechanical stretch (from volume or pressure overload),
acute ischemic injury, and a variety of other proinflammatory and
neurohormonal stimuli inducing myocardial stress. Although
secreted in 1:1 ratio, circulating levels of BNP and NT-proBNP
differ considerably due to different clearance characteristics. A
large number of studies have reported consistent associations
of baseline plasma BNP or NT-proBNP levels with a variety of
postoperative short- and long-term morbidity and mortality end
points, independent of the traditional risk factors. For noncar-
diac surgery, these have been summarized in two meta-analyses
that overall indicate an approximately 20-fold increase in risk of
adverse perioperative cardiovascular outcomes.17'' Similarly, for
cardiac surgery patients, preoperative BNP was a strong indepen-
dent predictor of inhospital postoperative ventricular dysfunction,
hospital length of stay, and 5-year mortality following primary
CABG,180 performing better than peak postoperative BNP.181 Peri-
operative plasma corin concentrations decrease in patients under-
going CABG surgery, and larger relative decreases are associated
with risk of long-term heart failure hospitalization and death.181
The current guidelines for preoperative cardiac risk assessment
in noncardiac surgery list BNP and NT-proBNP measurements as
class Ilb/level B indications.182 However, despite the large number
of studies conducted in both cardiac and noncardiac surgery, pre-
cise cut-off levels for BNP still need to be determined and adjusted
for age, gender, and renal function. Similarly, no BNP-based goal-
directed therapies have been reported in the perioperative period,
although a role for BNP assays in monitoring aortic valve disease
for optimal timing of surgery has been proposed.183 Furthermore,
Fox et al.184 found genetic variation in natriuretic peptide pre-
cursor genes (NPPA/NPPB) to be independently associated with
decreased risk of postoperative ventricular dysfunction following
primary CABG, whereas variants in natriuretic peptide receptor
NPR3 were associated with an increased risk (Table 6-3), offering
additional clues into the molecular mechanisms underlying post-
operative ventricular dysfunction.
Genetic variation in vascular reactivity and perioperative
adverse cardiac events. The perioperative period is character-
ized by robust activation of the sympathetic nervous system,
which plays an important role in the pathophysiology of PMI.
Thus, patients with CAD who carry specific polymorphisms
in adrenergic receptor (AR) genes can be at high risk for cat-
echolamine toxicity and cardiovascular complications. Several
functionally important SNPs modulating the AR pathways have
been described. 5 One of them is the Arg389Gly polymorphism
in prAR gene (ADRB1), an SNP associated with increased risk
of composite cardiovascular morbidity at 1 year after noncar-
diac surgery under spinal anesthesia.186 Of note, perioperative
P-blockade had no effect. These findings prompted the inves-
tigators to suggest that stratification on AR genotype in future
trials may help identify patients likely to benefit from periop-
erative P-blocker (BB) therapy. Significantly increased vascular
responsiveness to a-adrenergic stimulation (phenylephrine) has
been observed in carriers of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(NOS3) 894>T polymorphism,187 and angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) 1/D polymorphism98 undergoing cardiac surgery
with CPB. Conversely, certain patients, especially those undergo-
ing CPB for cardiac surgery, exhibit a form of vasodilatory shock
known as vasoplegic syndrome, with a reported incidence of
6 Genomic Basis of Perioperative Precision Medicine
8% to 20%. Although the precise mechanisms remain unclear,
vasoplegic syndrome and vasopressor requirements have been
associated with a common polymorphism in the dimethylargi-
nine dimethyl-aminohydrolase II (DDAH II) gene, an important
regulator of nitric oxide synthase activity,188 whereas a func-
tional SNP in angiotensin II type 1 receptor-associated protein
(AGTRAP), the negative regulator of angiotensin II receptor type 1,
is associated with decreased postoperative blood pressure fol-
lowing CABG as well as increased mortality in septic shock.189
Regulation of pulmonary vascular tone is also subject to genetic
regulation, and pediatric patients carrying the Glu298Asp poly-
morphism in NOS3 are more likely to develop acute postoperative
pulmonary hypertension following intracardiac repair of congen-
ital cardiac disease with CPB.190 Significant alterations in post-
operative endothelial function are observed following on-pump
cardiac surgery, and are associated with pronounced changes
in biomarkers of endothelial origin like soluble P-selectin and
SELE, tetranectin, von Willebrand factor, and ACE activity.191
Moreover, plasma concentrations of ILlp, soluble TREM-1,
endocan, and cfDNA are early predictive biomarkers of sterile-
SIRS after cardiovascular surgery.192 In addition to variability in
perioperative vascular tone, a genetic susceptibility to disturbed
fluid handling following cardiac surgery has also been identified,
with a common polymorphism in uromodulin (UMOD) gene as
well as a genetic risk score comprising 14 SNPs related to inflam-
matory and hemodynamic pathways associated with risk of post-
operative fluid overload.193 Differences in perioperative vascular
reactivity in relation to genetic variants of the P2-AR (ADRB2)
have similarly been noted in patients undergoing noncardiac sur-
gery. A common functional ADRB2 SNP (Glu27) was associated
with increased blood pressure responses to endotracheal intuba-
tion,194 whereas the incidence and severity of maternal hypoten-
sion and response to treatment in obstetric patients following
spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery was affected by ADRB2
genotype (Glyl6 and/or Glu27 led to lower vasopressor use for
the treatment of hypotension).195,196
GWAS and PRS for perioperative myocardial adverse events.
A common SNP at the 9p21 locus has been identified in several
replicated GWAS analyses to be associated with a wide array of
vascular phenotypes in ambulatory populations, including CAD,
MI, carotid atherosclerosis, abdominal aortic aneurysms, and
intracranial aneurysms. Two studies have validated the associa-
tion of polymorphisms at the 9p21 locus with both periopera-
tive myocardial injury197 and all-cause mortality after primary
CABG.198 The mechanism of action of this SNP in the develop-
ment of PMI and mortality is not completely understood, but
involves altered regulation of cell proliferation, senescence, and
apoptosis. It seems that cardiac surgery with CPB may trigger the
effects of the 9p21 gene variant leading to accumulation of senes-
cent cells or cells that show evidence of necrotic death with cel-
lular edema and lysis.
More recently, polymorphisms in the pregnancy-associated
plasma protein A2 (PAPPA2), histone deacetylase-4 (HDAC4),
and SEC24 family, member D (SEC24D, a member of the cyto-
plasmatic coat protein complex II), and two intergenic regions
were identified as part of a GWAS in patients undergoing CABG
to be associated with postoperative MI.110 These novel findings
implicate regulation of insulin-like growth factor bioavailability
and repair processes (PAPPA2), myocardial cell cycle progression,
differentiation, and apoptosis, with potential use in predicting
individual patient responsiveness to HD AC inhibition (HDAC4),
and endoplasmic reticulum trapping of misfolded proteins under
conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress such as ischemia
and oxidative injury (SEC24D). Although these observations are
intriguing, future follow-up studies will be needed to translate
these initial findings into biologic insights that could lead to pre-
dictive and therapeutic advances in perioperative care.
As discussed above, PRS allow us to test the aggregate effects
of multiple variants across the genome, weighted by their effect
sizes, on a given phenotype.199 The Michigan Genomics Initiative
investigative team tested the performance of a previously devel-
oped PRS for CAD (PRS^q) in predicting myocardial injury after
noncardiac surgery (MINS), defined as new troponin elevation
within 30 days postoperatively.200,201 While independently associ-
ated with MINS and contributing to reclassification of up to 3.6%
of patients into a new outcome category, addition of PRSqvd did
not significantly improve discrimination in models including the
benchmark RCRI, preoperative variables alone, or a combination
of preoperative and intraoperative variables, However, the results
point out the value of integrating genetic and EHR data in assess-
ing risk of postoperative adverse events.
Perioperative Atrial Fibrillation
Perioperative atrial fibrillation (PoAF) remains a significant
clinical problem after cardiac and noncardiac thoracic proce-
dures. With an incidence of 27% to 40%, PoAF is associated with
increased morbidity, hospital length of stay, rehospitalization,
health care costs, and reduced survival. This has prompted sev-
eral investigators to develop comprehensive indices for PoAF risk
prediction based on demographic, clinical, electrocardiographic,
and procedural risk factors. Nevertheless, the predictive accu-
racy of these risk indices remains limited, suggesting that genetic
variation may play a significant role in the occurrence of PoAE
Heritable forms of AF have been described in the ambulatory non-
surgical population, and it appears both monogenic forms like
“lone” AF as well as polygenic predisposition to more common
acquired forms like PoAF do exist. A GWAS found two polymor-
phisms on chromosome 4q25 to be significantly associated with
AF,108 findings replicated in other patient groups from Sweden,
the United States, and Hong Kong. Subsequendy, this locus was
also associated with new-onset PoAF after cardiac surgery with
CPB (CABG with or without concurrent valve surgery).202 The
mechanism of action of this genetic locus is not fully elucidated,
but it lies close to several genes involved in the development of
pulmonary myocardium (in particular, the transcription factor
PITX2c), or the sleeve of cardiomyocytes extending from the left
atrium into the initial portion of the pulmonary veins.
Other candidate susceptibility genes for PoAF include those
determining the duration of action potential (voltage-gated ion
channels, ion transporters), responses to extracellular factors
(adrenergic and other hormone receptors, heat shock proteins),
remodeling processes, and magnitude of inflammatory and oxi-
dative stress. It has been described that inflammation, reflected
by elevated baseline CRP or IL6 levels and exaggerated post-
operative leukocytosis, predicts the occurrence of PoAE A link
between inflammation and the development of PoAF is also sup-
ported by evidence that postoperative administration of nonste-
roidal anti-inflammatory drugs may reduce the incidence of PoAE
Several studies implicated a functional SNP in the IL6 promoter
(-174G>C) to be associated with higher perioperative plasma IL-6
levels and adverse outcomes after CABG, including PoAE203-205
Activation of innate immune responses has also recently been
suggested by results from the first GWAS of PoAF following
CABG, which identified a variant in lymphocyte antigen 96
(LY96) to be associated with decreased incidence of new-onset
PoAF after adjustment for clinical and procedural risk factors.111
In noncardiac surgery, candidate polymorphisms in IL6 and TNFA
genes have been shown to be associated with an increased risk
of postoperative morbidity, including new-onset arrhythmias 138
There is, however, a contradictory lack of association between
140
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
fl1
CRP levels (strongly regulated by IL-6) and PoAF in women
undergoing cardiac surgery,206 which may reflect gender-related
differences. On the other hand, both pre- and postoperative PAI-1
levels were independently associated with development of PoAF
following cardiac surgery.207
Polymorphisms in adrenergic pathway genes have also
been implicated in susceptibility to develop new-onset PoAF
after CABG. A functional variant in the 0rAR gene (AD RBI
Arg389Gly) was associated with PoAF, with effects modulated by
BB therapy, being stronger among patients without BB prophy-
laxis compared to those receiving BBs.208 Furthermore, in patients
undergoing CABG, polymorphisms in G-protein-coupled kinase
5 (GRK5) were associated with PoAF despite perioperative BB
therapy.209,210 GRK5 is expressed in the normal human heart, and
regulates cardiac inotropic and chronotropic actions of catechol-
amines by physiologically modulating 0-AR activity through
receptor phosphorylation, fyarrestin recruitment, uncoupling
from G proteins, and 0-AR desensitization. Although the mecha-
nism of action is incompletely understood, functional variants
in GRK5 modify the pradreneregic receptor signaling pathway
similar to partial receptor antagonism by BBs, thus altering their
effectiveness. In summary, these polymorphisms may provide
new insights into new-onset PoAF pathogenesis and differen-
tial responses to BB therapy, which can inform development of
personalized perioperative treatment strategies for this common
complication.
Most recently, the performance of a previously published
polygenic risk score of AF (PRSAF)211 was tested for prediction
of PoAF after cardiac surgery.212 In a cohort of 1,047 patients
of White European ancestry undergoing CABG or valve surgery,
addition of PRS^ to conventional clinical predictors improved
discrimination, calibration, and risk reclassification of PoAF
Another recent report investigated the association of 5 PRSs (AF,
MI, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and gastrointestinal bleeding)
with corresponding adverse events after coronary revascular-
ization in a large cohort of patients with CAD participating in
the Finnish FinnGen study. Only the PRSAF was independently
associated with PoAF across the three cohorts of patients under-
going percutaneous coronary intervention, CABG, or any revas-
cularization, improving model discrimination when added to
clinical risk factors.213 Furthermore, PRSs associated with higher
incidence of AF recurrence following direct current cardiover-
sion,214 or after catheter ablation215 have been reported, suggest-
ing potentially distinct genetic susceptibilities for AF onset and
AF recurrence.
Investigations in the transcriptional responses to AF in human
atrial appendage myocardium collected at the time of cardiac sur-
gery or in preclinical models (Table 6-2) have identified a ven-
tricular-like genomic signature in fibrillating atria, with increased
ratios of ventricular to atrial isoforms, suggesting dedifferen-
tiation.215 It remains unclear whether this “ventricularization” of
atrial gene expression reflects cause or effect of Afi but likely rep-
resents an adaptive energy-saving process to the high metabolic
demand of fibrillating atrial myocardium, akin to chronic hiberna-
tion. Because atrial tissue gene expression profiling may help to
determine how differentially expressed genes in the human atrium
before CPB are related to subsequent biologic pathway activation
patterns, and whether specific expression profiles are associated
with an increased risk for PoAF or altered response to BB ther-
apy after CABG suigery, we recently reported an eQTL analysis of
PoAF217 We found significant upregulation of VOPP1 gene (vesicu-
lar overexpressed in cancer-prosurvival protein 1) in patients with
PoAfi which was associated with transactivating variants in GRK5,
suggesting potential pathophysiologic roles of VOPP1 in PoAF
despite perioperative BB therapy. Patients who exhibit PoAF after
cardiac surgery also display a differential genomic response to CPB
in their peripheral blood leukocytes, characterized by upregula-
tion of oxidative stress genes correlated with a significant increase
in oxidant stress both systemically (as measured by total peroxide
levels) as well as at the myocardial level (as measured in the right
atrium).34 Finally, one study used high-resolution ‘H-NMR spec-
troscopy to conduct combined metabolomic and proteomic analy-
ses of atrial tissue samples obtained at the time of cardiac surgery
identified alterations in myocardial ketone metabolism associated
with persistent Afi and the ratio of glycolytic end products to end
products of lipid metabolism correlated positively with time of
onset of PoAF56
Ge^etk Marawte and Postoperative
Event-Free Survival
Large randomized clinical trials examining the benefits of CABG
surgery and percutaneous coronary interventions relative to med-
ical therapy and/or to one another have refined our knowledge of
early and long-term survival after CABG. Although these stud-
ies have helped define subgroups of patients who benefit from
surgical revascularization, they also revealed substantial vari-
ability in long-term survival after CABG, altered by important
demographic and environmental risk factors. Increasing evidence
suggests that the ACE gene indel polymorphism may influence
post-CABG complications, with carriers of the D allele having
higher mortality and restenosis rates after CABG surgery com-
pared with the 1 allele.136 As discussed earlier, a prothrombotic
amino acid alteration in the P3-integrin chain of the glycoprotein
llb/IIIa platelet receptor (the P1A2 polymorphism) is associated
with an increased risk for major adverse cardiac events (compos-
ite of MI, coronary bypass graft occlusion, or death) following
CABG surgery (Table 6-3).174 And variation at the chromosome
9p21 locus described earlier was associated with 5-year all-cause
mortality following CABG, and improved the predictive ability of
the EuroSCORE.198 We found preliminary evidence for associa-
tion of two functional SNPs modulating P2-AR activity (Argl6Gly
and Gln27Glu) with incidence of death or major adverse car-
diac events following cardiac surgery,218 and further identified
a functional polymorphism in thrombomodulin gene (THBD
Ala455Val) associated with increased 5-year mortality after CABG
independent of EuroSCORE.219
Genetic Susceptibility f©
Perioperative Neurologic Outcomes
Despite advances in surgical and anesthetic techniques, signifi-
cant neurologic morbidity continues to occur following cardiac
surgery, ranging in severity from coma and focal stroke (incidence
1% to 3%) to more subtle cognitive deficits (incidence up to 69%),
with a substantial impact on the risk of perioperative death, qual-
ity of life, and resource utilization. Variability in the reported inci-
dence of both early and late neurologic deficits remains poorly
explained by procedural risk factors, suggesting that environ-
mental (operative) and genetic factors may interact to determine
disease onset, progression, and recovery. The pathophysiology
of perioperative neurologic injury is thought to involve complex
interactions between primary pathways associated with athero-
sclerosis and thrombosis, and secondary response pathways like
inflammation, vascular reactivity, and direct cellular injury. Many
functional genetic variants have been reported in each of these
mechanistic pathways involved in modulating the magnitude and
the response to neurologic injury, which may have implications in
chronic as well as acute perioperative neurocognitive outcomes.
6 Genomic Basis of Perioperative Precision Medicine
For example, the interaction of minor alleles of the CRP (1846
C>T) and IL-6 promoter SNP -174G>C significandy increases the
risk of acute stroke after cardiac surgery.220 Similarly, P-selectin
and CRP genes, both modulate the susceptibility to postopera-
tive cognitive decline (POCD) following cardiac surgery.89 Spe-
cifically, the loss-of-function minor alleles of CRP 1059G>C and
SELP 1087G>A are independently associated with a reduction in
the observed incidence of POCD after adjustment for known clin-
ical and demographic covariates (Table 6-4).
Our group has initially reported an association between the
apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 genotype and adverse cerebral out-
comes in cardiac surgery patients.221,222 This is consistent with
the role of the APOE genotype in recovery from acute brain
injury, such as intracranial hemorrhage,223 closed head injury,224
and stroke,225 as well as experimental models of cerebral isch-
emia and ischemia-reperfusion injury226,227; two subsequent
studies in CABG patients, however, have not replicated these ini-
tial findings. Furthermore, the incidence of postoperative delir-
ium following major noncardiac surgery in the elderly228 and in
critically ill patients229 is increased in carriers of the APOE e4
allele. Unlike adult cardiac surgery patients, infants possessing
the APOE e2 allele are at increased risk for developing adverse
neurodevelopmental sequelae following cardiac surgery.230,231
The mechanisms by which the APOE genotypes might influ-
ence neurologic outcomes have yet to be determined, but do not
seem to be related to alterations in global cerebral blood flow or
oxygen metabolism during CPB232; however, genotypic effects in
modulating the inflammatory response,141 extent of aortic ather-
oma burden,233 and risk for premature coronary atherosclerosis234
may play a role.
Consistent with the observed role of platelet activation in
the pathophysiology of adverse neurologic sequelae, genetic
variants in surface platelet membrane glycoproteins, impor-
tant mediators of platelet adhesion and platelet-platelet inter-
actions, increase the susceptibility to prothrombotic events.
Among these, the P1A2 polymorphism in glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa
has been related to various adverse thrombotic outcomes,
including acute coronary thrombosis235 and atherothrombotic
stroke.236 Notably, the P1A2 allele is to be associated with more
severe neuro cognitive decline after CPB,90 which could repre-
sent exacerbation of platelet-dependent thrombotic processes
associated with plaque embolism.
Cardiac surgical patients who develop POCD demonstrate
inherently different genetic responses to CPB from those with-
out POCD, as evidenced by acute deregulation of gene expres-
sion pathways involving inflammation, antigen presentation,
and cellular adhesion in peripheral blood leukocytes.33 These
findings corroborate with proteomic changes, in which patients
with POCD similarly have significantly higher serologic
inflammatory indices compared with those patients without
POCD,237,238 and adds to the increasing level of evidence that
CPB does not cause an indiscriminate variation in gene expres-
sion, but rather distinct patterns in specific pathways that are
highly associated with the development of postoperative com-
plications such as POCD. The implications for perioperative
medicine include identifying populations at risk who might
benefit not only from an improved informed consent, strati-
fication, and resource allocation, but also from targeted anti-
inflammatory strategies.
In noncardiac surgery, a study conducted in patients undergo-
ing carotid endarterectomy concluded that preoperative plasma
levels of fibrinogen and hs-CRP were independently associated
with new periprocedural cerebral ischemic lesions caused by
microembolic events, as determined by MRI diffusion-weighted
239
imaging.
Genetic Susceptibility to .Adverse
Perioperative Kidney totomes
AKI is a common, serious complication of cardiac surgery; about
8% to 15% of patients develop moderate renal injury (>1.0 mg/dL
peak creatinine rise), and up to 5% of them develop renal fail-
ure requiring dialysis.240 AKI is independently associated with
inhospital mortality rates, exceeding 60% in patients requiring
dialysis.241 Several studies have demonstrated that inheritance of
genetic polymorphisms in the APOE gene (e4 allele)94 and in the
promoter region of the IL6 gene (-174 C allele)203 are associated
with AKI following CABG surgery (Table 6-5). We have reported
that major differences in peak postoperative serum creatinine
rise after CABG are predicted by carrying combinations of poly-
morphisms that interestingly differ by race: the angiotensinogen
(AGT) 842 T>C and IL6 -572G>C variants in Caucasians, and the
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) 894G>T and ACE I/D in
African Americans are associated with more than 50% reduction
in postoperative glomerular filtration rate.92 A recent GWAS of
cardiac surgery-associated AKI identified two novel susceptibil-
ity loci, one located in the Bardet-Biedl syndrome 9 (BBS9) gene,
potentially implicating abnormalities in the primary renal cilia
function in the pathogenesis of AKI.113 An additional susceptibility
locus for AKI after cardiac surgery was reported in PH Domain and
Leucine Repeat Protein Phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2) gene, involved in
regulation of the prosurvival kinase pathway.242 Conversely, a two-
institution GWAS analysis found no significant association with
postoperative AKI following noncardiac surgery.243 Moreover, a
previously published PRS of estimated glomerular filtration rate244
was not significandy associated with postoperative AKI in this
cohort, with an overall low estimated heritability around 4.5%.243
Nevertheless, further identification of genotypes predictive of
adverse perioperative renal outcomes may facilitate individually
tailored therapy, risk stratify the patients for interventional trials
targeting the gene product itself, and aid in medical decision mak-
ing (e.g., selecting medical over surgical management).
Genetic Variants and Risk for
Postoperative Acute Lung Injury
Prolonged mechanical ventilation (inability to extubate patient
by 24 hours postoperatively) is a significant complication fol-
lowing cardiac surgery, occurring in 5.6% and 10.5% of patients
undergoing first and repeat CABG surgery, respectively.245 Several
pulmonary and nonpulmonary causes have been identified, and
scoring systems based on preoperative and procedural risk factors
have been proposed and validated. Recently, genetic variants tn
the renin-angiotensin pathway and in proinflammatory cytokine
genes have been associated with respiratory complications post-
CPB. The D allele of a common functional I/D polymorphism in the
ACE gene, accounting for 47% of variance in circulating ACE lev-
els,246 is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation follow-
ing CABG,247 and with susceptibility to and prognosis of ARDS.248
Furthermore, a hyposecretor haplotype in the neighboring genes
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFA) and lymphotoxin alpha (LIA)
on chromosome 6 (TNFA-308G/LIA+250G haplotype)249 and a
functional polymorphism modulating postoperative interleukin-6
levels (IL6—174G>C)2Cto are independently associated with higher
risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation post-CABG. The associa-
tion is more dramatic in patients undergoing conventional CABG
than in those undergoing off-pump CABG (OPCAB), suggesting
that in high-risk patients identified by preoperative genetic screen-
ing OPCAB may be the optimal surgical procedure. In children,
plasma gelsolin and sRAGE have been reported to improve predic-
tion of CPB-induced acute lung injury.250,251
142
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
Pharmacogenomics
and Anesthesia
Interindividual variability in response to drug therapy, both in
terms of efficacy and safety, is a rule by which anesthesiologists
live. In fact, much of the art of anesthesiology is the astute clinician
being prepared to deal with outliers. The term pharmacogenomics
is used to describe how inherited variations in genes modulat-
ing drug actions are related to interindividual variability in drug
response. Such variability in drug action may be pharmacokinetic
or pharmacodynamic (Fig. 6-5). Pharmacokinetic variability refers
to variability in a drug’s absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
excretion that mediates its efficacy and/or toxicity. The molecules
involved in these processes include drug-metabolizing enzymes
(such as members of the cytochrome P450, or CYP, superfam-
ily), and drug transport molecules that mediate drug uptake into,
and efflux from, intracellular sites. Pharmacodynamic variability
refers to variable drug effects despite equivalent drug delivery to
molecular sites of action. This may reflect variability in the func-
tion of the molecular target of the drug, or in the pathophysi-
ologic context in which the drug interacts with its receptor target
(e.g., affinity, coupling, expression).252 Thus, pharmacogenomics
investigates complex, polygenically determined phenotypes of
drug efficacy or toxicity, with the goal of identifying novel thera-
peutic targets and customizing drug therapy.
Historically, characterization of the genetic basis for plasma
pseudocholinesterase deficiency in 1956 was of fundamen-
tal importance to anesthesia and the further development and
understanding of genetically determined differences in drug
response. Moreover, research to refine the genetic underpin-
nings of malignant hyperthermia, a rare autosomal-dominant
genetic disease of skeletal muscle calcium metabolism triggered
by administration of general anesthesia with volatile anesthetic
agents or succinylcholine in susceptible individuals, revealed
that MH susceptibility results from a complex interaction
between multiple genes and environment.253 Although direct
DNA testing in the general population for susceptibility to MH
is currently not recommended, testing individuals with a posi-
tive family history has the potential to greatly reduce mortality
and morbidity.254
Genefk Variability in Response
to Anesthetic Agents
Anesthetic potency, defined by the minimum alveolar concen- ■ 3;
tration (MAC) of an inhaled anesthetic that abolishes purpose-
ful movement in response to a noxious stimulus, varies among
individuals, with a coefficient of variation (the ratio of standard
deviation to the mean) of approximately 10% (^ NICV 6-1). This
observed variability may be explained by interindividual differ-
ences in multiple genes that underlie responsiveness to anesthet-
ics, by environmental or physiologic factors (brain temperature,
age), or by measurement errors. With growing public concern
over intraoperative awareness, understanding the mechanisms
responsible for this variability may facilitate implementation of
patient-specific preventative strategies. Evidence of a genetic basis
for increased anesthetic requirements is beginning to emerge,
suggested for instance by variability in the immobilizing dose of
sevoflurane (as much as 24%) in populations with different ethnic
(and thus genetic) backgrounds.255
Based on combined pharmacologic and genetic in vivo stud-
ies to date, several receptors are unlikely to be direct mediators of
MAC, including the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABAa) (despite
their compelling role in IV anesthetic-induced immobility), 5-HT3,
AMPA, kainate, acetylcholine and OtyARs, and potassium chan-
nels.256 Glycine, NMDA receptors, and sodium channels remain
likely candidates.257 These conclusions, however, do not apply to
other anesthetic end points, such as hypnosis, amnesia, and anal-
gesia. Several preclinical proteomic analyses have identified in a
more unbiased way a group of potential anesthetic targets for halo-
thane,43 desfhirane,44 and sevoflurane,45 which should provide the
basis for more focused studies of anesthetic binding sites. Such
“omic” approaches have the potential to evolve into preoperative
screening profiles useful in guiding individualized therapeutic
decisions, such as prevention of anesthetic awareness in patients
with a genetic predisposition to increased anesthetic requirements.
Genetic Variability in Pain
Similar to the observed variability in anesthetic potency, the
response to painful stimuli and analgesic manipulations var-
ies among individuals. Increasing evidence suggests that pain
Figure 6-5 Pharmacogenomic determinants of individual drug response operate by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mecha-
nisms. A: Genetic variants in drug transporters (e.g ATP-bindmg cassette subfamily B member 1 or ABCB1 gene) and drug-metabolizinq enzymes
(e.g, cytochrome P450 2D6 or CYP2D6 gene, CYP2C9 gene, N-acetyltransferase or NAT2 gene, plasma cholinesterase or BCHE gene) are responsible
for pharmacokinetic variability in drug response. B: Polymorphisms in drug targets (e.g, p, and p2-adrenergic receptor ADRB1 ADRB2 qenes- angio-
tensm-l converting enzyme ACE gene), postreceptor signa ng molecules (e.g, guanine nucleotide binding protein p3 or GNB3 gene) or molecules
indirectly affecting drug response (e.g, various ion channel genes involved in drug-induced arrhythmias) are sources of pharmacodynamic variability.
6
Genomic Basis of Perioperative Precision Medicine
behavior in response to noxious stimuli and its modulation by
the central nervous system in response to drug administration or
environmental stress, as well as the development of persistent pain
conditions through pain amplification, are strongly influenced by
genetic factors.258-260 Results from studies in twins261 and inbred
mouse strains262 indicate a moderate heritability for chronic pain
syndromes and nociceptive sensitivity, which appears to be medi-
ated by multiple genes. Various strains of knockout mice lacking
target genes like neurotrophins and their receptors (e.g., nerve
growth factor), peripheral mediators of nociception and hyper-
algesia (e.g., substance P), opioid and nonopioid transmitters
and their receptors, and intracellular signaling molecules have
significantly contributed to the understanding of pain processing
mechanisms.263 A locus responsible for 28% of phenotypic vari-
ance in magnitude of systemic morphine analgesia in mouse has
been mapped to chromosome 10, in or near the OPRM (|l-opioid
receptor) gene. The p.-opioid receptor is also subject to pharma-
codynamic variability, polymorphisms in the promoter region
of the OPRM gene modulating interleukin-4-mediated gene
expression have been correlated with morphine antinociception.
The much quoted OPRM 188 A>G polymorphism is associated
with decreased responses to morphine-6-glucuronide, resulting
in altered analgesic requirements, but also reduced incidence of
postoperative nausea and vomiting, and reduced risks of toxicity
in renal failure patients. Conversely, variants of the melanocor-
tin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene, which produce a red hair-fair skin
phenotype, are associated with increased analgesic responses to
K-opioid agonists in women but not men, providing evidence
for a gene-by-gender interaction in regulating analgesic response
(for a review, see Somogyi et al.264). Previous reports suggest that
peripherally located fi2-ARs (ADRB2) also contribute to basal
pain sensitivity and the development of chronic pain states, as
well as opioid-induced hyperalgesia.260 Functionally important
haplotypes in the ADRB2.i:>9 and catechol-O-methyltransferase
(COMT)265 genes are associated with enhanced pain sensitivity
in humans. Pain sensitivity has been established as a predictor of
acute postoperative pain, and for risk for developing chronic pain
conditions. A recent large GWAS of pain sensitivity assessed by
questionnaire and a cold pressor test identified a new susceptibil-
ity locus in the EIPR1 (endosome-associated recycling protein)
gene and confirmed previous findings that females with red hair
were more sensitive to pain, with genetic variation in MC1R asso-
ciated with an increase in self-perceived pain sensitivity.266
4	In addition to the genetic control of peripheral nociceptive
pathways, considerable evidence exists for genetic variability
in the descending central pain modulatory pathways, further
explaining the interindividual variability in analgesic respon-
siveness. One good example relevant to analgesic efficacy is
cytochrome P450D6 (CYP2D6), a member of the superfamily of
microsomal enzymes that catalyze phase 1 drug metabolism, and
responsible for the metabolism of a large number of therapeu-
tic compounds. The relationship between the CYP2D6 genotype
and the enzyme metabolic rate has been extensively character-
ized, with at least 12 known mutations leading to a tetramodal
distribution of CYP2D6 activity: ultrarapid metabolizers (5% to
7% of the population), extensive metabolizers (60%), intermedi-
ate metabolizers (25%), and poor metabolizers (10%). Currently,
pharmacogenomic screening tests predict CYP2D6 phenotype
with more than 95% reliability. The consequences of inheriting an
allele that compromises CYP2D6 function include the inability to
metabolize codeine (a prodrug) to morphine by O-demethylation,
leading to lack of analgesia but increased side effects from the
parent drug (e.g., fatigue) in poor metabolizers.253,258 Based on
the known large effects of allelic variation at the CYP2D6 locus on
metabolism of at least codeine and tramadol, and possibly oxy-
codone and hydrocodone, and more limited data for OPRM1 and
COMT loci, guidelines for dosing are now provided by the Clini-
cal Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium (CPIC).267
In an insightful analysis of the potential role of PRS for predic-
tion of therapeutic responses in patients with opioid use disorder,
Gibson268 reviewed three potential targets for prediction of opioid
response: identification of individuals at high risk of addiction,
identification of poor metabolizers, and identification of ultrar-
apid metabolizers.
Variability m Response to Other
Drugs Used Perioperatively
A wide variety of drugs used in the perioperative period display
significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic variability that
is genetically modulated (Table 6-6). Although such genetic varia-
tion in drug-metabolizing enzymes or drug targets usually results
in unusually variable drug response, genetic markers associated
with rare but fife-threatening side effects have also been described.
Of note, the most commonly cited categories of drugs involved in
adverse drug reactions include cardiovascular, antibiotic, psychi-
atric, and analgesic medications, and interestingly, each category
has a known genetic basis for increased risk of adverse reactions.
There are more than 30 families of drug-metabolizing enzymes
in humans, most with genetic polymorphisms shown to influence
enzymatic activity. Of special importance to the anesthesiologist is
the CYP2D6, one of the most intensively studied and best under-
stood examples of pharmacogenetic variation, involved in the
metabolism of several drugs including analgesics (codeine, dex-
tromethorphan), BBs, antiarrhythmics (flecainide, propafenone,
quinidine), and diltiazem. CYP2D6 is also involved in the bio-
transformation of ondansetron, and its genetic variation resulting
in the so-called ultrarapid metabolizing phenotype has been asso-
ciated with increased incidence of ondansetron failure for the pre-
vention of postoperative vomiting but not nausea,269 which was
even more pronounced if tropisetron was used as an antiemetic
treatment.270 Joint assessment of genotype-dependent CYP2D6
and CYP3A4 activities revealed that ondansetron metabolism is
enantioselective, and doubling the ondansetron dose is ineffective
in patients with high CYP2D6/3A4 activity.271
Another important pharmacogenetic variation has been
described in cytochrome P450C9 (CYP2C9'), involved in metabo-
lizing anticoagulants (warfarin), anticonvulsants (phenytoin),
antidiabetic agents (glipizide, tolbutamide), and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (celecoxib, ibuprofen), among others.
Three known CYP2C9 variant alleles result in different enzyme
activities (extensive, intermediate, and slow metabolizer phe-
notypes), and have clinical implications in the increased risk
of life-threatening bleeding complications in slow metabolizers
during standard warfarin therapy. This illustrates the concept of
“high-risk pharmacokinetics,” which applies to drugs with low
therapeutic ratios eliminated by a single pathway (in this case,
CYP2C9-mediated oxidation); genetic variation in that pathway
may lead to large changes in drug clearance, concentrations,
and effects.252 Dose adjustments based on the pharmacogenetic
phenotype have been proposed for drugs metabolized via both
CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 pathways,253 and a commercially avail-
able, FDA-approved test (CYP450 AmpliChip, Roche Molecular
Diagnostics) allows clinicians for the first time to test patients
for a wide spectrum of genetic variation in drug-metabolizing
enzymes. The strongest evidence to date for use of pharmacoge-
nomic testing is to aid in the determination of warfarin dosage by
using genotypes in the CYP2C9 and vitamin K epoxide reductase
complex 1 (VKORC1) genes, with four FDA-approved tests now
commercially available. Furthermore, CYP2C9 genotypes and age
could be used in patients on chronic warfarin therapy awaiting
elective surgery to inform the time required to discontinue the

drug preoperatively (rather than uniformly applying the 5-day
recommended guidelines) and thus potentially avoiding the costs
associated with surgical delays.272
Genetic variation in drug targets (receptors) can have pro-
found effect on drug efficacy, and over 25 examples have already
been identified. For example, functional polymorphisms in the
P2-AR (ArglbGly, Gln27Glu) influence the bronchodilator and
vascular responses to 0-agonists, and prAR variants (Arg389Gly)
modulate responses to BBs and may impact postoperative cardio-
vascular adverse events.185,186 An excellent review by Nagele273
provides a strong rationale for using pharmacogenomic variation
in BB metabolism (CYP2D6) and receptor signaling pathways
(both ADRB1, ADRB2, and downstream genes) to determine the
effectiveness and safety of perioperative P-blockade for preven-
tion of perioperative MI, particularly given the conflicting results
raised by the POISE trial.274 Finally, clinically important genetic
polymorphisms with indirect effects on drug response have been
described. These include variants in candidate genes like sodium
(SCN5 A) and potassium ion channels (KCNH2, KCNE2, KCNQ1),
which alter susceptibility to drug-induced long QT syndrome and
ventricular arrhythmias (torsade de pointes) associated with the
use of drugs like erythromycin, terfenadine, disopyramide, sotalol,
cisapride, or quinidine. Carriers of such susceptibility alleles have
no manifest QT-interval prolongation or family history of sudden
death until QT-prolonging drug challenge is superimposed.252
Predisposition to QT-interval prolongation (considered a surro-
gate for risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias) has been
responsible for more drug withdrawals from the market than any
other category of adverse event in recent times, so understanding
genetic predisposing factors constitutes one of the highest priori-
ties of current pharmacogenomic efforts.
Leveraging genetic information to improve prediction of peri-
operative complications through implementation of pharmacoge-
nomic-guided interventions requires integration of genotypes into
the EHR for clinicians to contextualize the information as part
of clinical decision support tools. In a proof of principle study,
Douville et al. analyzed pharmacogenes associated with three
anesthetic complications with well-characterized genetic inheri-
tance—butyrylcholinesterase deficiency, factor V Leiden, and
malignant hyperthermia—using an open-source script designed
for clinican use. Although they found strong associations between
genotypes and EHR-derived phenotypes, many genetic suscepti-
bilities were not documented in the EHR either as part of the fam-
ily history or clinical features of the conditions.275
Complementary to pharmacogenomics, pharmacometabonorn-
ics describes the use of metabolic profiling of biofluids, tissues,
and tissue extracts to predict, prior to dosing, the beneficial and
adverse effects of an intervention such as drug administration.276
This has been proposed as a potential significant development for
precision medicine because of its ability to longitudinally sample
both genetic and environmental factors (surgical stress, rapid
fluid shifts, alterations in gut microbiome) that influence drug
transport, metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity in a patient.
Pharmacogenomics is emerging as an additional modifying
component to anesthesia along with age, gender, comorbidities,
and medication usage. Specific testing and treatment guidelines

6 Genomic Basis of Perioperative Precision Medicine
allowing clinicians to appropriately modify drug utilization (e.g.,
adjust dose or change drug) already exist for a few compounds,253
and will likely be expanded to all relevant therapeutic compounds
(Fig. 6-2), together with identification of novel therapeutic targets.
Conclusions and Future Directions
The Human Genome Project has revolutionized all aspects of
medicine, allowing us to assess the impact of genetic variability on
disease taxonomy, characterization, and outcome, and individual
responses to various drugs and injuries. Mechanistically, informa-
tion gleaned through genomic approaches is already unraveling
long-standing mysteries behind general anesthetic action and
adverse responses to drugs used perioperatively. To take full advan-
tage of the unique opportunities offered by the genomic revolution
and begin implementing precision medicine concepts, the cycle of
innovation in perioperative medicine must shift to a new framework
which includes comprehensive and standardized definitions of the
phenotypes of interest (including short- and long-term adverse
outcomes such as organ injury/dysfunction, organ support-free
days, adverse drug responses, transition to chronic pain, as well as
novel intermediate outcomes that may not be considered patient
centric by current standards)7,277 by developing and refining EHR-
driven pheno typing algorithms,278 followed by identification of the
underlying genes and dynamic genomic markers, characterization
of the mechanism from DNA to phenotype, robust data integration
and data science tools, and rigorous development and validation
of actionable companion diagnostics implemented at the point
of care using EHR-integrated clinical decision support tools (Fig.
6-2).279 For the anesthesiologist, this may soon translate into pro-
spective risk assessment incorporating genetic profiling of markers
important in thrombotic, inflammatory, vascular, and neurologic
responses to perioperative stress, with impheations ranging from
individualized additional preoperative testing and physiologic
optimization to choice of perioperative monitoring strategies and
critical care resource utilization. Furthermore, genetic profiling of
drug-metabolizing enzymes, carrier proteins, and receptors, using
currendy available high-throughput molecular technologies, will
enable personalized choice of drugs and dosage regimens tailored
to suit a patient’s pharmacogenetic profile. At that point, periop-
erative physicians will have far more robust information to use
in designing the most appropriate and safest anesthetic plan for a
given patient. At the same time, considerable progress should be
made in understanding risks and benefits of personalization versus
protocolization. Theoretically, homogenizing the treatment given
to a highly heterogeneous patient population falling under a wide
syndromic umbrella (e.g., sepsis)73 or subject to various surgical
procedures through the use of bundles and protocols may result in
compromised outcomes in an individual patient. Benefit from an
intervention in one subset may be negated by harm in another, or
diluted out by noneffect in a majority subset.280
6 Although one of the aims of the Human Genome Project
is to improve therapy through genome-based prediction, the
birth of personal genomics opens up a Pandora’s box of ethical
issues, including privacy and the risk for discrimination against
individuals who are genetically predisposed for a medical dis-
order. Such discrimination may include barriers to obtaining
health, life, or long-term care insurance, or obtaining employ-
ment. Thus, extensive efforts are made to protect patients
participating in genetic research from prejudice, discrimination,
or uses of genetic information that will adversely affect them.
To address the concerns of both biomedical research and health
communities, the U.S. Senate has approved in 2003 the Genetic
Information and Nondiscrimination Act, which provides the
strong safeguards required to protect the public participating in
human genome research. Another ethical concern is the trans-
ferability of genetic tests across ethnic groups, particularly in
the prediction of adverse drug responses. It is known that most
polymorphisms associated with variability in drug response
show significant differences in allele frequencies among popu-
lations and racial groups. Furthermore, the patterns of linkage
disequilibrium are markedly different between ethnic groups,
which may lead to spurious findings when markers, instead of
causal variants, are used in diagnostic tests extrapolated across
populations. In exploring racial disparities in health and disease
outcomes, considerable debate has focused on whether race and
ethnic identity are primarily social or biologic constructs, and
the contribution of genetic variability in explaining observed dif-
ferences in the rates of disease between racial groups. With the
goal of personalized medicine being the prediction of risk and
treatment of disease on the basis of an individual’s genetic profile,
some have argued that biologic consideration of race will become
obsolete. However, in this discovery phase of the postgenome
era, continuing to incorporate racial information in genetic stud-
ies should improve our understanding of the architecture of the
human genome, and its implications for novel strategies aiming
at identifying variants protecting against, or conferring suscep-
tibility to, common diseases and modulating drug effects.281,282

Introduction
1 If physicians are to be practitioners of scientific medicine, they
must read the language of science to be able to independently
assess and interpret the scientific report. Without exception,
the language of medicine is increasingly statistical. This chapter
provides a brief review of some of the most important elements
of experimental design and statistical analysis for the clinical
anesthesiologist.
Foundations
Statistics is a method for working with sets of numbers. A typi-
cal scientific hypothesis asks which of two interventions is better,
X or Y. Statistical methods are necessary because there are sources
of variation in any data set, including random biologic variation
and measurement error. These errors in the data cause difficulties
in avoiding bias and in being precise. Bias keeps the true value
from being known and fosters incorrect decisions; precision deals
with the problem of data scatter and with quantifying the uncer-
tainty about the value in the population from which a sample is
drawn. These statistical methods are relatively independent of the
particular field of study.
Date Structure
Data collected in an experiment include the defining characteris-
tics of the experiment and the values of events or attributes that
vary over time or conditions. The former are called explanatory
variables and the latter are called response variables. Variables such
as gender, age, and doses of accompanying drugs reflect the vari-
ability of the experimental subjects. Explanatory variables, it is 2
hoped, describe the systematic variations in the response variables.

Table 7-1 Data Types		
Data Type	Definition	Examples
Interval 			
Discrete Continuous	Data measured with an integer- only scale Data measured with a constant scale interval	Parity, number of teeth Blood pressure, temperature
Categorical
Dichotomous	Binary data	Mortality, gender
Nominal	Qualitative data that cannot be ordered or ranked	Eye color, drug category
Ordinal	Data ordered, ranked, or mea- sured without a constant scale interval	American Society of Anesthesiolo- gists (ASA) phys- ical status score, pain score
Response variables are also called dependent variables. Res-
ponse variables reflect the primary properties of experimental
interest in the subjects. Research in anesthesiology is particularly
likely to have repeated measurement variables; that is, a particu-
lar measurement recorded more than once for each individual.
Some variables can be both explanatory and response; these are
called intermediate response variables. Suppose an experiment
is conducted comparing electrocardiography and myocardial
responses between five doses of an opioid. One might analyze
how ST segments depended on the dose of opioids; here, maxi-
mum ST-segment depression is a response variable. Maximum ST-
segment depression might also be used as an explanatory variable
to address the subtler question of the extent to which the effect
of an opioid dose on postoperative myocardial infarction can be
accounted for by ST-segment changes.
The mathematical characteristics of the possible values of a
variable fit into five classifications (Table 7-1). Properly assigning
a variable to the correct data type is essential for choosing the
correct statistical technique. For interval variables, there is equal
distance between successive intervals; the difference between 15
and 10 is the same as the difference between 25 and 20. Discrete
interval data can have only integer values; for example, number of
living children. Continuous interval data are measured on a con-
tinuum and can be a decimal fraction; for example, blood pres-
sure can be described as accurately as desired (e.g., 136, 136.1,
or 136.14 mm Hg). The same statistical techniques are used for
discrete and continuous data.
Putting observations into two or more discrete subsets
describes the concept of categorical variables; for statistical
analysis, numeric values are assigned as labels to the categories.
Dichotomous data allow only two possible values; for example,
male versus female. Ordinal data have three or more categories
that can logically be ranked or ordered; however, the ranking or
ordering of the variable indicates only relative and not absolute
differences between values; for example, there is not necessarily
the same difference between American Society of Anesthesiolo-
gists Physical Status score I and II as there is between III and IV.
Although ordinal data are often treated as interval data in choos-
ing a statistical technique, alternative techniques for ordinal data
are available and may in fact be preferable. Nominal variables are
placed into categories that have no logical ordering. The eye col-
ors blue, hazel, and brown might be assigned the numbers 1, 2,
and 3, but these values have no meaning.
Descriptive Statistics
There are concise ways of summarizing the data from any experi-
ment called descriptive statistics. These numbers are called sample
or summary statistics.1,2 By convention, the symbols of summary
statistics are Roman letters. The two summary statistics most fre-
quendy used for interval variables are the central location and the
variability, but there are others. Different data types have analo-
gous summary statistics. Although the first purpose of descriptive
statistics is to describe the numbers obtained in a sample, there is
also the desire to use the summary statistics from the sample to
characterize the population from which the sample was derived.
The population also has measures of central location and variabil-
ity called the parameters of the population; Greek letters denote
population parameters. Usually, the population parameters can-
not be direcdy calculated because data from all population mem-
bers cannot be obtained. The beauty of properly chosen summary
statistics is that they are the best possible estimators of the popu-
lation parameters.
These sampling statistics can be used in conjunction with a
probability density function to provide additional descriptions
of the sample and its population. Also commonly described as a
probability distribution, a probability density function is an alge-
braic equation,J(x), which gives a theoretical percentage distribu-
tion ofx. Each value of x has a probability of occurrence given by
J(x). The most important probability distribution is the normal or
x —11
Q
two parameters (population mean and population variance) in
the equation of the normal function that are denoted |1 and o2.
Often called the normal equation, it can be plotted and produces
the familiar bell-shaped curve. Why are the mathematical proper-
ties of this curve so important to biostatistics? First, it has been
empirically noted that when a biologic variable is sampled repeat-
edly, the pattern of the numbers plotted as a histogram resembles
the normal curve; thus, most biologic data are said to follow or to
obey a normal distribution. Second, if it is reasonable to assume
that a sample is from a normal population, the mathematical
properties of the normal equation can be used with the sampling
statistic estimators of the population parameters to describe the
sample and the population. Third, a mathematical theorem (the
central limit theorem) allows the use of the assumption of nor-
mality for certain purposes, even if the population is not normally
distributed.

Central Location
The three most common summary statistics of central location
for interval variables are the arithmetic mean, median, and mode.
The mean is merely the average of the numbers in the data set.
Being a summary statistic of the sample, the arithmetic mean
is denoted by the Roman letter x under a bar or x = — Xi-i*1
n
where i is the index of summation and n is the count of objects in
the sample. If all values in the population could be obtained, then
the population mean p could be calculated similarly. Because all
values of the population cannot be obtained, the sample mean
is used. (Statisticians describe the sample mean as the unbiased,
7 Experimental Design and Statistics
consistent, minimum variance, sufficient estimator of the popula-
tion mean. Thus, the sample mean x is the estimator of the popu-
lation mean p..)
The median is the middlemost number or the number that
divides the sample into two equal parts after first ranking the
sample values from lowest to highest and then counting halfway
to obtain the median. The concept of ranking is used in nonpara-
metric statistics. A virtue of the median is that it is hardly affected
by a few extremely high or low values.
The mode is the most popular number in a sample; that is, the
number that occurs most frequendy. A sample may have more
than one value that is most common, that is, it may be bi- or poly-
modal; these modes may be widely separated or adjacent. The raw
data should be inspected for this unusual appearance. The mode
is often mentioned in discussions of descriptive statistics, but it is
rarely used in statistical practice.
Spread or Variability
Any set of interval data has variability unless all the numbers are
identical. Variability is specified by calculating the deviation or
deviate of each individual x, from the center (mean) for all the
XjS. The sum of the squared deviates is always positive unless all
set values are identical. This sum is then divided by the number
of individual measurements. The result is the averaged squared
deviation; the average squared deviation is ubiquitous in statistics.
The concept of describing the spread of a set of numbers by
calculating the average distance from each number to the cen-
ter of the numbers applies to both a sample and a population;
this average squared distance is called the variance. The popula-
tion variance is a parameter and is represented by cP. As with the
population mean, the population variance is not usually known
and cannot be calculated. Just as the sample mean is used in place
of the population mean, the sample variance is used in place of
the population variance. The sample variance is VAR = SD2 =
Statistical theory demonstrates that if the divi-
sor in the formula for SD2 is (n — 1) rather than n, the sample vari-
ance is an unbiased estimator of the population variance. While
the variance is used extensively in statistical calculations, the
units of variance are squared units of the original observations.
The square root of the variance has the same units as the origi-
nal observations; the square roots of the sample and population
variances are called the sample (SD) and population (a) standard
deviations.
It was previously mentioned that most biologic observations
appear to come from populations with normal distributions. By
accepting this assumption of a normal distribution, further mean-
ing can be given to the sample summary statistics (mean and SD)
that have been calculated. This involves the use of the expression
x ± k X SD where k = 1, 2,3, and so forth. If the population from
which the sample is taken is unimodal and roughly symmetric,
then the bounds for k = 1, 2, and 3 encompass roughly 68%, 95%,
and 99%, respectively, of the sample and population members.
Types of Research Design
Ultimately, research design consists of choosing what subjects to
study, what experimental conditions and constraints to enforce,
and which observations to collect at what intervals.3,4 A few key
features in this research design largely determine the strength of
scientific inference that can be made based on the collected data.
These key features allow the classification of research reports
Table 7-2 Classification of Clinical Research
Reports
I. Longitudinal studies
A. Prospective (cohort) studies
1. Studies of deliberate intervention
a. Concurrent controls
b. Historical controls
2. Observational studies
B. Retrospective (case-control) studies
II. Cross-sectional studies
(Table 7-2). This classification reveals the variety of experimental
approaches and indicates strengths and weaknesses of the same
design applied to many research problems.
The first distinction is between longitudinal and cross-sectional
studies. The former is the study of changes over time, whereas
the latter describes a phenomenon at a certain point in time. For
example, reporting the frequency with which certain drugs are
used during anesthesia is a cross-sectional study, whereas investi-
gating the hemodynamic effects of different drugs during anesthe-
sia is a longitudinal analysis.
Longitudinal studies are next classified by the method with
which the research subjects are selected. The methods for choos-
ing research subjects can be either prospective or retrospective;
these two approaches are also known as cohort (prospective) or
case-control (retrospective). A prospective study assembles groups
of subjects by some input characteristic that is thought to change
an output characteristic; a typical input characteristic would be
the opioid drug administered during anesthesia; for example,
remifentanil or fentanyl. A retrospective study gathers subjects
by an output characteristic; an output characteristic is the sta-
tus of the subject after an event; for example, the occurrence of
a myocardial infarction. A prospective (cohort) study would be
one in which a group of patients undergoing neurologic surgery
was divided into two groups, given two different opioids (remi-
fentanil or fentanyl), and followed for the development of a peri-
operative myocardial infarction. In a retrospective (case-control)
study, patients who suffered a perioperative myocardial infarction
would be identified from hospital records; a group of subjects of
similar age, gender, and disease who did not suffer a perioperative
myocardial infarction also would be chosen, and the two groups
would then be compared for the relative use of the two opioids
(remifentanil or fentanyl). Retrospective studies are a primary
tool of epidemiology. A case-control study can often identify an
association between an input and output characteristic, but the
causal fink or relationship between the two is more difficult to
specify.
Prospective studies are further divided into those in which
the investigator performs a deliberate intervention and those in
which the investigator merely observes. In a study of deliberate
intervention, the investigator would choose several anesthetic
maintenance techniques and compare the incidence of postop-
erative nausea and vomiting (j^ NICV 7-1). If it was performed
as an observational study, the investigator would observe a group
of patients receiving anesthetics chosen at the discretion of each
patient’s anesthesiologist and compare the risk of postoperative
nausea and vomiting among the anesthetics used. Obviously, in
this example of an observational study, there has been an inter-
vention; an anesthetic has been given. The crucial distinction is
whether the investigator controlled the intervention. An observa-
tional study may reveal differences among treatment groups, but
whether such differences are the consequence of the treatments or
of other differences among the patients receiving the treatments
154
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
will remain obscure. The comparison of cohorts with interven-
tions not assigned under experimental control is a prominent
technique of epidemiology.
Studies of deliberate intervention are further subdivided into
those with concurrent controls and those with historical controls.
Concurrent controls are either a simultaneous parallel control
group or a self-control study; historical controls include previous
studies and literature reports. A randomized controlled trial (RCT)
is thus a longitudinal, prospective study of deliberate intervention
with concurrent controls.
Innovative clinical trialists and statisticians have added several
novel variations of clinical trial design including adaptive design,3
platform trials,6 stepped-wedge trials,7 noninferiority8 and equiv-
alence trials,9 pragmatic trials,10 and others11; these new trial
designs are increasingly used. Although most of this discussion
about experimental design has focused on human experimenta-
tion, the same principles apply and should be followed in animal
experimentation. The randomized, controlled clinical trial is the
most potent scientific tool for evaluating medical treatment; ran-
domization into treatment groups is relied on to equally weight
the subjects of the treatment groups for baseline attributes that
might predispose or protect the subjects from the outcome of
interest.
Experimental Medicine:
Management of Bias
Case reports engender interest, suspicion, doubt, wonder, and
perhaps the desire to experiment; however, the case report is not
sufficient evidence to advance scientific medicine. The experi-
menter attempts to constrain and control, as much as possible,
the environment in which they collect numbers to find associa-
tions and relationships. The elements of experimental design are
intended to prevent and minimize the possibility of bias, that is,
a deviation of results or inferences from the true state of nature.
Sampling
In statistical language, population and sample have specialized
meanings. Instead of referring only to the count of individuals
in a geographic or political region, population refers to any target
group of things (animate or inanimate) in which there is interest.
A typical target population might be mothers in the first stage
of labor or head-trauma victims undergoing craniotomy. A target
population could also be cell cultures or hospital bills. A sample
is a subset of the target population. Samples are taken because
of the impossibility of observing the entire population; it is gen-
erally not affordable, convenient, or practical to examine more
than a relatively small fraction of the population. Nevertheless,
the researcher wishes to generalize from the results of the small
sample group to the entire population.
Alike in at least one way, population members are generally
quite diverse in other ways. The researcher desires that the sample
of subjects in the experiment is representative of the population’s
diversity. Head-injury patients can have open or closed wounds,
a variety of coexisting diseases, and normal or increased intra-
cranial pressure. These subgroups within a population are called
strata. Often the researcher wishes to increase the sameness or
homogeneity of the target population by further restricting the
sample and the population to just a few strata. However, restrict-
ing the target population to eliminate too much diversity must be
balanced against the desire to have the results be applicable to the
broadest possible population of patients.
The best hope for a representative sample of the population
would be realized if every subject in the population had the same
chance of being observed; this is called simple random sampling. If
there were several strata of importance, stratified random sampling
from each stratum would be appropriate. Other types of sam-
pling including cluster and systematic methods are also used. In
most clinical anesthesia studies, researchers are limited to using
those patients who happen to show up at their hospitals; this is
called convenience sampling. Convenience sampling is subject to
the nuances of the surgical schedule, the goodwill of the refer-
ring physician and attending surgeon, and the willingness of the
patient to cooperate. At best, the convenience sample is represen-
tative of patients at that institution, with no assurance that these
patients are similar to those elsewhere. Convenience sampling is
also the rule in studying new anesthetic drugs; such studies are
typically performed on healthy, young volunteers.
Experimental Constraints
The researcher must define the conditions to which the sample
members will be exposed. Particularly in clinical research, one
must decide whether these conditions should be rigidly stan-
dardized or whether the experimental circumstances should
be adjusted or individualized to the patient. In anesthetic drug
research, should a fixed dose be given to all members of the
sample or should the dose be adjusted to produce an effect or to
achieve a specific end point? Standardizing the treatment groups
by fixed doses simplifies the research work. There are risks to this
standardization. They include the following: (1) a fixed dose may
produce excessive numbers of side effects in some patients; (2)
a fixed dose may be therapeutically insufficient in others; and
(3) a treatment standardized for an experimental protocol may
be so artificial that it has no broad clinical relevance, even if dem-
onstrated to be superior. The researcher should carefully choose
and report the adjustment/individualization of experimental
treatments.
Control Cronj^s
Even if a researcher is studying just one experimental group, the
results of the experiment are usually not interpreted solely in
terms of that one group but are also contrasted and compared
with other experimental groups. Examining the effects of a new
drug on blood pressure during anesthetic induction is impor-
tant, but what is more important is comparing those results with
the effects of one or more standard drugs commonly used in the
same situation. Where can the researcher obtain these compara-
tive data? There are several possibilities: (1) each patient could
receive the standard drug under identical experimental circum-
stances at another time; (2) another group of patients receiving
the standard drug could be studied simultaneously; (3) a group
of patients could have been studied previously with the standard
drug under similar circumstances; and (4) literature reports of
the effects of the drug under related but not necessarily identi-
cal circumstances could be used. Under the first two possibili-
ties, the control group is contemporaneous—either a self-control
(crossover) or parallel control group. The second two possibilities
are examples of the use of historical controls.
Because historical controls already exist, they are convenient
and seemingly cheap to use. Unfortunately, the history of medi-
cine is littered with the “debris” of therapies enthusiastically
accepted on the basis of comparison with past experience. A clas-
sic example is operative ligation of the internal mammary artery
for the treatment of angina pectoris—-a procedure now known to
be of no value. Proposed as a method to improve coronary artery
7 Experimental Design and Statistics
blood flow, the lack of benefit was demonstrated in a trial where
some patients had the procedure and some had a sham procedure;
both groups showed benefit.12 There is now firm empirical evi-
dence that studies using historical controls usually show a favor-
able outcome for a new therapy, whereas studies with concurrent
controls, that is, parallel control group or self-control, less often
reveal a benefit.13 Nothing seems to increase the enthusiasm for
a new treatment as much as the omission of a concurrent control
group. If the outcome with an old treatment is not studied simul-
taneously with the outcome of a new treatment, one cannot know
if any differences in results are a consequence of the two treat-
ments, or of unsuspected and unknowable differences between the
patients, or of other changes over time in the general medical envi-
ronment. One possible exception would be in studying a disease
that is uniformly fatal (100% mortality) over a very short time.
Kswtom Allocation of Treatosnt Groups
How should each subject be assigned to a specified experimen-
tal group? Should it depend on the whim of the investigator, the
day of the week, the preference of a referring physician, the wish
of the patient, the assignment of the previous subject, the avail-
ability of a study drug, a hospital chart number, or some other
arbitrary criterion? All such methods have been used, but all can
ruin the usefulness of the experiment. It is important to remember
the purpose of sampling: by exposing a small number of subjects
from the target population to the various experimental condi-
tions, one hopes to make inferences about the entire population.
Thus, the experimental groups should be as similar as possible to
each other in reflecting the target population; if the groups are sys-
tematically different, selection bias is introduced into the experi-
ment. Although randomly allocating subjects of a sample to one
or another of the experimental groups requires additional work,
this principle prevents selection bias by the researcher, minimizes
(but cannot always prevent) the possibility that systematic differ-
ences exist among the experimental groups, and disarms critics’
complaints about research methods. Random allocation is most
commonly accomplished by the use of computer-generated ran-
dom numbers. Even with a random allocation process, selection
bias can occur if research personnel are allowed knowledge of the
group assignment of the next patient to be recruited for a study.
Failure to conceal random allocation leads to biases in the results
of clinical studies.14 Well-described techniques (centralized ran-
dom allocation, opaque sealed envelopes, etc.) are successful in
preventing this form of selection bias.15 RCTs are the appropri-
ate standard for establishing efficacy. Nevertheless, observational
studies often will report the same magnitude of effect.16,17
Blinding
Blinding refers to the masking from the view of patient and experi-
menters the experimental group to which the subject has been or
will be assigned. In clinical trials, the necessity for blinding starts
even before a patient is enrolled in the research study; this is called
the concealment of random allocation. There is good evidence that,
if the process of random allocation is accessible to view, the refer-
ring physicians, the research team members, or both are tempted
to manipulate the entrance of specific patients into the study to
influence their assignment to a specific treatment group.18
They do so having formed a personal opinion about the rela-
tive merits of the treatment groups and desiring to get the “best”
for someone they favor. This creates selection bias in the experi-
mental groups.
Each subject should remain, if possible, ignorant of the
assigned treatment group after entrance into the research
protocol. The patient’s expectation of improvement, a placebo
effect, is a real and useful part of clinical care. But when studying
a new treatment, one must ensure that the fame or infamy of the
treatments does not induce a bias in outcome by changing patient
expectations. A researcher’s knowledge of the treatment assign-
ment can bias their ability to administer the research protocol
and to observe and record data faithfully; this is true for clinical,
animal, and in vitro research. If the treatment group is known,
those who observe data cannot trust themselves to record the date
impartially and dispassionately. The appellations single-blind and
double-blind to describe blinding are commonly used in research
reports, but often applied inconsistently; the researcher should
carefully plan and report exactly who is blinded.
Experimental Medicine:
Data Analysis
The researcher starts work with some intuition about the phenom-
enon to be studied. Whether stated explicidy or not, this is the
biologic hypothesis; it is a statement of observational or experimen-
tal expectations to be accomplished by using observations, tools,
instruments, or methods accessible to the research team. An exam-
ple would be the hope that isoflurane would produce less myo-
cardial ischemia than fentanyl; the experimental method might
be the electrocardiography determination of ST-segment changes.
The researcher measures quantities that can vary—variables such
as heart rate or temperature or ST-segment change—in samples
from populations of interest. The workflow of date analysis con-
sists of descriptive statistics (see above) to describe the properties
of the observed sample date and inferential statistics to infer prop-
erties of the population. The most common method of inferential
statistics is the use of P values in null significance hypothesis test-
ing (NSHT).19 The biologic hypothesis of the researcher becomes
a statistical hypothesis during research planning.
Null S/gn/f7cance Hypothesis
Test Formulation
In a statistical hypothesis, statements are made about the relation-
ship among parameters of one or more populations. (To restate,
a parameter is a number estimated from variables in a sample
that describes a population; Roman letters label variables and
Greek letters are used to denote parameters.) The typical statisti-
cal hypothesis can be established in a somewhat rote fashion for
every research project, regardless of the methods, materials, or
goals. The most frequently used method of setting up the alge-
braic formulation of the statistical hypothesis is to create two
mutually exclusive statements about some parameters of the study
population (Table 7-3); estimates for the values for these param-
eters are acquired by sampling date. In the hypothetical example
comparing isoflurane and fentanyl, and f2 would represent
the ST-segment changes with isoflurane and with fentanyl. The
Table 7-3 Algebraic Statement of Statistical
Hypotheses
Ho: fi = fi (null hypothesis)
Ha: f-t * f2 (alternative hypothesis)
= Parameter estimated from sample of first population
f2 = Parameter estimated from sample of second population
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
null hypothesis is the hypothesis of no difference of ST-segment
changes between isoflurane and fentanyl. The alternative hypoth-
esis is usually nondirectional, that is, either Jj <f2 or fi >f2; this is
known as a two-tail alternative hypothesis. This is a more conserva-
tive alternative hypothesis than assuming that the inequality can
only be either less than or greater than.
Logic of Proof
One particular decision strategy is used most commonly to choose
between the null and alternative hypothesis. The approach is to
assume that the null hypothesis is true even though the goal of
the experiment is to show that there is a difference. One exam-
ines the consequences of this assumption by examining the actual
sample values obtained for the variable(s) of interest. This is done
by calculating what is called a sample test statistic; sample test sta-
tistics are calculated from the sample numbers. Associated with a
sample test statistic is a probability, usually designated the P value.
One also chooses the level of significance; the level of significance
is the probability level considered too low to warrant support of
the null hypothesis being tested. If sample values are sufficiently
unlikely to have occurred by chance (i.e., the probability of the
sample test statistic is less than the chosen level of significance),
the null hypothesis is rejected; otherwise, the null hypothesis is
not rejected.
It is often assumed that only the observed sample values are
relevant for making inferences from the value of the test statistic
and the associated P value. In fact, all statistical inferences depend
on a complex web of assumptions. This is commonly labeled a
statistical model. Typical assumptions of a statistical model include
(1) measurements are independent of each other; (2) variability
is constant across measurements; and (3) sample values actually
represent the population of interest. Assumptions are usually diffi-
cult to verify. The P value becomes a logical test of all the assump-
tions, not just is (pj = <j)2. The P value may be large or small because
the assumptions are incorrect.20
Because the statistics deal with probabilities, not certainties,
there is a chance that the decision concerning the null hypoth-
esis is erroneous. These errors are best displayed in table form
(Table 7-4); condition 1 and condition 2 could be different drugs,
two doses of the same drug, or different patient groups. Of the
four possible outcomes, two decisions are clearly undesirable.
The error of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis (false-positive)
is called the type I or alpha error. The experimenter should choose
a probability value for alpha before collecting data; the experi-
menter decides how cautious to be against falsely claiming a dif-
ference. The most common choice for the value of alpha is 0.05.
What are the consequences of choosing an alpha of 0.05? Assum-
ing that there is, in fact, no difference between the two conditions
and that the experiment is to be repeated 20 times, then during
one of these experimental replications (5% of 20), a mistaken
conclusion that there is a difference would be made. The prob-
ability of a type I error depends on the chosen level of significance
and the existence or nonexistence of a difference between the
two experimental conditions. The smaller the chosen alpha, the
smaller will be the risk of a type I error.
The error of failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false-
negative) is called a type II or beta error. (The power of a test
is 1 minus beta.) The probability of a type II error depends on
four factors. Unfortunately, the smaller the alpha, the greater the
chance of a false-negative conclusion; this fact keeps the experi-
menter from automatically choosing a very small alpha. Also, the
more variability there is in the populations being compared, the
greater the chance of a type II error. This is analogous to listening
to a noisy radio broadcast; the more static there is, the harder it
will be to discriminate between words. In addition, increasing the
number of subjects will lower the probability of a type II error.
The fourth and most important factor affecting the probability of
a type II error is the magnitude of the difference between the two
experimental conditions. The probability of a type II error varies
from very high, when there is only a small difference, to extremely
low, when the two conditions produce large differences in popula-
tion parameters.
Samp/e Calculations
Formerly, researchers typically ignored type II errors in experi-
mental design. The practical importance of worrying about type
II errors reached the consciousness of the medical research com-
munity several decades ago. Some controlled clinical trials that
claimed to find no advantage of new therapies compared with
standard therapies lacked sufficient statistical power to discrimi-
nate between the experimental groups and would have missed an
important therapeutic improvement. As an example, the formula
for calculating the size of each sample in a study comparing the
2
means of two populations is: n = 2
(gq ~
Hi ~|k
The z values
are taken from the normal probability distribution and represent
assumptions about the prespecified alpha and beta; the sigma (o)
is the assumed common SD; the mu’s (p) are the assumed popu-
lation values. There are four options for decreasing type II error
(increasing statistical power): (1) raise alpha; (2) reduce popula-
tion variability; (3) make the sample bigger; and (4) make the
difference between the conditions greater. Under most circum-
stances, only the sample size can be varied. Sample size planning
has become an important part of research design for controlled
clinical trials.21 Some published research still fails the test of ade-
quate sample size planning.

7 Experimental Design and Statistics
Samp/e Test Statistics
s NSHT has been the main focus of inferential statistics. Hypothesis
testing allows the experimenter to use data from the sample to
make inferences about the population. Statisticians have created
formulas that use the values of the samples to calculate test sta-
tistics. Statisticians have also explored the properties of various
theoretical probability distributions. Depending on the assump-
tions about how data are collected, the appropriate probability
distribution is chosen as the source of critical values to accept or
reject the null hypothesis. If the value of the test statistic calcu-
lated from the sample(s) is greater than the critical value, the null
hypothesis is rejected. The critical value is chosen from the appro-
priate probability distribution after the magnitude of the type I
error is specified.
There are parameters within the equation that generate any
particular probability distribution; for the normal probability dis-
tribution, the parameters are [1 and o2. For the normal distribu-
tion, each set of values for |1 and o2 will generate a different shape
for the bell-like normal curve. All probability distributions con-
tain one or more parameters and can be plotted as curves; these
parameters may be discrete (integer only) or continuous. Each
value or combination of values for these parameters will create a
different curve for the probability distribution being used. Thus,
each probability distribution is actually a family of probability
curves. Some additional parameters of theoretical probability dis-
tributions have been given the special name degrees of freedom and
are represented by Roman letters such as m, n, and s.
Associated with the formula for computing a test statistic is a
rule for assigning integer values to the degrees of freedom. The
number of degrees of freedom and the value for each degree of
freedom depend on (1) the number of subjects; (2) the number of
experimental groups; (3) the specifics of the statistical hypothesis;
and (4) the type of statistical test. The correct curve of the prob-
ability distribution from which to obtain a critical value for com-
parison with the value of the test statistic is obtained with the
values of one or more degrees of freedom.
To accept or reject the null hypothesis, the following steps are
performed: (1) confirm that experimental data conform to the
assumptions of the intended statistical test; (2) choose a signifi-
cance level (alpha); (3) calculate the test statistic; (4) determine
the degree(s) of freedom; and (5) find the critical value for the
chosen alpha and the degree(s) of freedom from the appropri-
ate probability distribution. If the test statistic exceeds the criti-
cal value, reject the null hypothesis; if the test statistic does not
exceed the critical value, do not reject the null hypothesis.
fihs uffs P Vs Jus
There is an extremely common misapprehension about the
meaning of the P value in the typical null hypothesis/alternative
hypothesis testing format.22,23 If a statistical test is declared to
be significant at P < 0.05, most physicians will state that there
is 95% or greater certainty that the null hypothesis is incorrect.
As Steven Goodman has stated: “This is an understandable but
categorically wrong interpretation because the P value is calcu-
lated on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. It can-
not, therefore, be a direct measure of the probability that the null
hypothesis is false.”22 The odds that the desired outcome—the
alternative hypothesis—is true will depend not just on the data
of the experiment, but also on how plausible was the hypoth-
esis. This interaction of hypothesis plausibility and statistical
results can be displayed graphically. (See Fig. 7-i.)24 An implau-
sible hypothesis (19-to-l odds against) stills remains implausible
(11% chance of a real effect) even if the P value of the experiment
is 0.05.

Basic Science and Fundamentals
The Bayesian Alternative
Be it an RTC or an observational study report, the results and
claims of medical research are not and should not be consid-
ered in isolation from prior knowledge. Yet, the most commonly
used methods of statistical inference applied to medical research
explicidy use only the newly obtained data. This is the frequen-
tist approach or inference, so called because the precise definition
of probability values depends on assumptions about hypothetical
repeated replication of data collection. The new information of a
study is a function only of the data.
5	A competing approach is called Bayesian inference that explic-
itly reports the new information of a study as a function of both
observed data and historical (prior) knowledge. Both frequentist
and Bayesian inferences make statements about parameters. But
Bayesian methods involve the multiplication of the prior knowl-
edge represented as a probability distribution of the parameter(s)
times the likelihood of the observed data; the product is the new
(posterior) probability distribution of the parameter.26-30 Bayes-
ian methods have been proposed to resolve the conundrum that
some highly cited clinical research whose evidence is interpreted
by a frequentist P value is later contradicted or found to be exces-
sively optimistic in the magnitude of effect.31-34 Among reasons
for the slower adoption of Bayesian methods are concerns about
the subjectivity in defining the prior probability distribution and
the considerably greater computational difficulty in performing
an analysis. Many public domain software packages have become
available for Bayesian analyses, resolving some of the computa-
tional challenges.35
Experimental Medicine:
Statistical Tests
interval Data
Parametric statistics are the usual choice in the analysis of inter-
val data, both discrete and continuous. The purpose of such
analysis is to test the hypothesis of a difference between popula-
tion means. The population means are unknown and are esti-
mated by the sample means. A typical example would be the
comparison of the mean heart rates of patients receiving and not
receiving atropine. Parametric test statistics have been developed
by using the properties of the normal probability distribution
and two related probability distributions, the t and the F distri-
butions. In using such parametric methods, the assumption is
made that the sample or samples is/are drawn from population(s)
with a normal distribution. The parametric test statistics that
have been created for interval data all have the form of a ratio.
In general terms, the numerator of this ratio is the variability of
the means of the samples; the denominator of this ratio is the
variability among all the members of the samples. These vari-
abilities are similar to the variances developed for descriptive
statistics. The test statistic is thus a ratio of variabilities or vari-
ances. All parametric test statistics are used in the same fashion;
if the test statistic ratio becomes large, the null hypothesis of no
difference is rejected. The critical values against which to com-
pare the test statistic are taken from tables of the three relevant
probability distributions (normal, t, or F). In hypothesis test-
ing, at least one of the population means is unknown, but the
population variance(s) may or may not be known. Parametric
statistics can be divided into two groups according to whether
or not the population variances are known. If the population
variance is known, the test statistic used is called the z score;
critical values are obtained from the normal distribution. In most
biomedical applications, the population variance is unknown,
and the z score is little used.
Confidence Intervals
The other major areas of statistical inference are the estimation
of parameters with associated confidence intervals (Cis). In statis-
tics, a CI is an interval estimate of a population parameter. A CI
describes how likely it is that the population parameter is esti-
mated by any particular sample statistic such as the mean. (The
technical definition of the CI of the mean is more rigorous. A 95%
CI implies that if the experiment were done over and over again,
95 of each 100 Cis would be expected to contain the true value of
the mean.) Cis are a range of the following form: summary statis-
tic + (confidence factor) x (precision factor).
The precision factor is derived from the sample itself, whereas
the confidence factor is taken from a probability distribution
and also depends on the specified confidence level chosen.
For a sample of interval data taken from a normally distrib-
uted population for which Cis are to be chosen for x, the pre-
cision factor is called the standard error of the mean and is
obtained by dividing SD by the square root of the sample size or
5E = = -^)2/n(n-1)-
The confidence factors are the same as those used for the dis-
persion or spread of the sample and are obtained from the nor-
mal distribution. The Cis for confidence factors 1, 2, and 3 have
roughly a 68%, 95%, and 99% chance of containing the popula-
tion mean. Stricdy speaking, when the SD must be estimated from
sample values, the confidence factors should be taken from the
t distribution, another probability distribution. These coefficients
will be larger than those used previously. This is usually ignored if
the sample size is reasonable; for example, n > 25. Even when the
sample size is only five or greater, the use of the coefficients 1, 2,
and 3 is simple and sufficiently accurate for quick mental calcula-
tions of Cis on parameter estimates.
Almost all research reports include the use of SE, regardless
of the probability distribution of the populations sampled. This
use is a consequence of the central limit theorem, one of the most
remarkable theorems in all of mathematics. The central limit the-
orem states that the SE can always be used (if the sample size is
sufficiently large) to specify Cis around the sample mean. These
Cis are calculated as previously described. This is true even if the
population distribution is so different from normal that SD cannot
be used to characterize the dispersion of the population members.
Only rough guidelines can be given for the necessary sample size;
for interval data, 25 and above is large enough, and 4 and below
is too small.
Although the SE is often discussed along with other descrip-
tive statistics, it is really an inferential statistic. SE and SD are
usually mentioned together because of their similarities of com-
putation, but there is often confusion about their use in research
reports in the form “mean ± number.” Some confusion results
from the failure of the author to specify whether the number after
the ± sign is the one or the other. The choice is actually simple-
When describing the spread, scatter, or dispersion of the sample,
use SD; when describing the precision with which the population
mean is known, use SE.
t-Test
An important advance in statistical inference came early in the
20th century with the creation of the Student’s t-t'est statistic
and the t distribution, which allowed the testing of hypotheses
when the population variance is not known. The most common
use of the Student’s t-test is to compare the mean values of two
7 Experimental Design and Statistics
populations. There are two types of t-tests. If each subject has two
measurements taken, for example, one before (xf) and one after
(yf) a drug, then a one-sample or paired t-test procedure is used;
each control measurement taken before drug administration is
paired with a measurement in the same patient after drug admin-
istration. Of course, this is a self-control experiment. This pair-
ing of measurements in the same patient reduces variability and
increases statistical power. The difference di = xi—yioi each pair of
values is calculated and the average d is calculated. In the formula
for the Student’s t statistic, the numerator is d, whereas the denom-
inator is the SE of d denoted (SEg) so the test statistic is t =
SEg
All t statistics are created in this way; the numerator is the
difference of two means, whereas the denominator is the SE of
the two means. If the difference between the two means is large
compared with their variability, then the null hypothesis of no dif-
ference is rejected. The critical values for the t statistic are taken
from the t probability distribution. The t distribution is symmetric
and bell shaped but more spread out than the normal distribu-
tion. The t distribution has a single integer parameter; for a paired
t-test, the value of this single degree of freedom is the sample size
minus one. There can be some confusion about the use of the let-
ter t. It refers both to the value of the test statistic calculated by the
formula and to the critical value from the theoretical probability
distribution. The critical t value is determined by looking in a t
table after a significance level is chosen and the degree of freedom
is computed.
More commonly, measurements are taken on two separate
groups of subjects. For example, one group receives blood pres-
sure treatment with sample values x,, whereas no treatment is
given to a control group with sample values yf. The number of
subjects in each group might or might not be identical; regard-
less of this, in no sense is an individual measurement in the first
group matched or paired with a specific measurement in the
second group. In this scenario, an unpaired or two-sample t-test
is used to compare the means of the two groups. The numera-
tor of the t statistic is x — y. The denominator is a weighted
average of the SDs of each sample so that the test statistic t is
t = , *~~y---------------------------------.
( 1 | 1 V(nx-l)s^+(ny-l)sy5
y tlx Uy j tlx + lly 2 ,
The degree of freedom for an unpaired t-test is calculated as
the sum of the subjects of the two groups minus two. As with
the paired t-test, if the t ratio becomes large, the null hypothesis
is rejected.
The results of a comparison of samples from two populations
should be complete. In addition to displaying the individual mean
values of x and y with their Cis and the results of the t-test, the
mean difference, x - y is also included with its associated CI.
This difference of means is the effect size, a quantitative measure
of the magnitude of effect.36 The reporting of the effect size facili-
tates the interpretation of the clinical importance, as opposed to
the statistical significance, of a research result.37,38
Analysis of Variance
Experiments in anesthesia, whether they are with humans or with
animals, may not be limited to one or two groups of data for each
variable. It is very common to follow a variable longitudinally;
heart rate, for example, might be measured five times before
and during anesthetic induction. These are also called repeated
measurement experiments; the experimenter will wish to compare
changes between the initial heart rate measurement and those
obtained during induction. The experimental design might also
include several groups receiving different induction drugs; for
example, comparing heart rate across groups immediately after
laryngoscopy. Researchers have mistakenly handled these analysis
problems with just the t-test. If heart rate is collected five times,
these collection times could be labeled A, B, C, D, and E. Then A
could be compared with B, C, D, and E; B could be compared with
C, D, and E; and so forth. The total of possible pairings is 10; thus,
10	paired t-tests could be calculated for all the possible pairings of
A, B, C, D, and E. A similar approach can be used for comparing
more than two groups for unpaired data.
The use of t-tests in this fashion is inappropriate. In testing
a statistical hypothesis, the experimenter sets the level of type I
error; this is usually chosen to be 0.05. When using many t-tests,
as in the example given earlier, the chosen error rate for per-
forming all these t-tests is much higher than 0.05, even though
the type I error is set at 0.05 for each individual comparison. In
fact, the type I error rate for all t-tests simultaneously; that is, the
chance of finding at least one of the multiple t-test statistics sig-
nificant merely by chance is given by the formula a = 1 — 0.95K.
If 13 t-tests are performed (k = 13), the real error rate is 49%.
Applying t-tests over and over again to all the possible pairings of
a variable will misleadingly identify statistical significance when
in fact there is none.
The most versatile approach for handling comparisons of
means between more than two groups or between several mea-
surements in the same group is called analysis of variance and is
frequently cited by the acronym ANOVA. Analysis of variance
consists of rules for creating test statistics on means when there
are more than two groups. These test statistics are called F ratios,
after statistician Ronald Fisher; the critical values for the F test
statistic are taken from the F probability distribution that Fisher
derived.
Suppose that data from three groups are obtained. What can
be said about the mean values of the three target populations?
The F test is actually asking several questions simultaneously: is
group 1 different from group 2?; is group 2 different from group
3?; and is group 1 different from group 3? As with the t-test, the
F-test statistic is a ratio; in general terms, the numerator expresses
the variability of the mean values of the three groups, whereas
the denominator expresses the average variability or difference of
each sample value from the mean of all sample values. The for-
mulas to create the test statistic are computationally elegant but
are rather hard to appreciate intuitively. The F statistic has two
degrees of freedom, denoted m and n; the value of m is a func-
tion of the number of experimental groups; the value for n is a
function of the number of subjects in all experimental groups.
The analysis of multigroup data is not necessarily finished after
the ANOVAs are calculated. If the null hypothesis is rejected and
it is accepted that there are differences among the groups tested,
how can it be decided where the differences are? A variety of tech-
niques are available to make what are called multiple comparisons
after the ANOVA test is performed.
Robustness and Nonparametric Tests
All statistical tests depend on certain assumptions; these include
the distribution of values in the underlying populations from
which experimental samples are taken and the distribution of the
test statistic. For the parametric statistics, that is, t-tests and anal-
ysis of variance, it is assumed that the populations follow the nor-
mal distribution. However, for some data, experience or historical
reasons suggests that these assumptions of a normal distribution
do not hold; some examples include proportions, percentages,
and response times. What should the experimenter do if they fear
that the data are not normally distributed?

The experimenter might choose to ignore the problem of
nonnormal data and inhomogeneity of variance, hoping that
everything will work out. Such insouciance is actually a very
practical and reasonable approach to the problem. Parametric
statistics are called robust statistics; they stand up to much adver-
sity. To a statistician, robustness implies that the magnitude of
type I errors is not seriously affected by ill-conditioned data.
Parametric statistics are sufficiently robust that the accuracy of
decisions reached by means of t-tests and analysis of variance
remains very credible, even for moderately severe departures
from the assumptions.
Another possibility would be to use statistics that do not
require any assumptions about probability distributions of the
populations. Such statistics are known as nonparametric tests;
they can be used whenever there is very serious concern about
the shape of the data. Nonparametric statistics are also the tests of
choice for ordinal data. The basic concept behind nonparametric
statistics is the ability to rank or order the observations; nonpara-
metric tests are also called order statistics.
Most nonparametric statistics still require the use of theoretical
probability distributions; the critical values that must be exceeded
by the test statistic are taken from the binomial, normal, and chi-
square distributions, depending on the nonparametric test being
used. The nonparametric sign test, Mann-Whitney rank sum test,
and Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance are analogous to
the paired t-test, unpaired t-test, and one-way analysis of variance,
respectively. The currently available nonparametric tests are not
used more commonly because they do not adapt well to complex
statistical models and because they are less able than parametric
tests to distinguish between the null and alternative hypotheses if
the data are, in fact, normally distributed. There are general guide-
lines that relate the variable type and the experimental design to
the choice of statistical test (Table 7-5).
Binary Variables
Confidence Intervals on Proportions
Categorical binary data, also called enumeration data, provide
counts of subject responses. Given a sample of subjects of whom
some have a certain characteristic (e.g., death, female sex), a ratio
of responders to the number of subjects can be easily calculated as
p = x/n; this ratio or rate can be expressed as a decimal fraction or
as a percentage. It should be clear that this is a measure of central
location of binary data. In the population from which the sample
is taken, the ratio of responders to total subjects is a population
parameter, denoted it. (This is not related to the geometry con-
stant ft = 3.14159 . . .). The sample proportion p is the estimator
(ft) of the population proportion it. As with other data types, it is
usually not known but must be estimated from the sample. The
sample ratio p is the best estimate of 7t.
Because the population parameter is not generally known, the
experimenter usually wishes to estimate it by the sample ratio p
and to specify with what precision it is known. If the sample is
sufficiently large (n x p > 5; n x (1 - p) > 5), advantage is taken
of the central limit theorem to derive an SE analogous to that
, . , r . , j rr IPX(1~ P^> Tl.. 1 Ct
denved for interval data—SE = J-------------. This sample SE
V n
is exacdy analogous to the sample SE of the mean for interval
data, except that it is an SE of the proportion. Just as a 95% Cl of
the mean was calculated, so may a CI on the proportion may be
obtained. Larger samples will make the CI more precise.
If nothing goes wrong, is everything all right? This question
was proposed by Henley and Lippman-Hand to discuss the inter-
pretations of zero numerators using the 3 over n rule.39 Consider
an observational study that reports no morbidity in a 167 patients
receiving a new intravenous anesthetic. Is there really no risk?
While the best estimate of the population parameter it is 0/167
or 0%, an upper bound on the 95% CI is relevant to consider
how high the rate of adverse events might be. As the probabil-
ity of binary data is provided by the binomial probability distribu^
tionJunction, this upper bound may be derived from 1 - (0.05)"1
where n is the denominator; for n > 30, this is well approximated
by 3/n = 3/167 = 1.8%.
The zero numerator example can be used to illustrate a dif-
ference between a Bayesian and frequentist approach. If there is
no prior information (Bayes-Laplace beta probability distribution
Junction'), the upper bound is 3/(n + 1) = 3/168 ~ 1.8%; the Bayes-
ian equivalent of a CI is called a credible interval (CrI).40 As the
sample size increases, 3/n and 3/(n +1) becomes closer and closer.
By contrast, when there is prior information, Bayesian inference
will provide a smaller CrI than a frequentist approach CL Suppose
a prior study with the same new anesthetic had found 15 mor-
bid events in 10,000 (0.15%) patients. Then, with the new data,
the estimate of the population rate of morbidity is 0.12% (upper
bound 95% CrI = 0.36%).40 Using prior information and the new
data of zero events in 167 patients, the population rate estimate
has been reduced from 0.15% to 0.12%, and the upper bound of
the 95% CrI is much lower (0.36% vs. 1.8%) than by frequentist
estimation.
Hypothesis Testing
In an RCT comparing hyperbaric bupivacaine versus hyper-
baric lidocaine for spinal anesthesia, 9 of the 35 patients (26%)
in the lidocaine group had transient neurologic symptoms
(TNS) while only 1 of the 35 (3%) patients in the bupivacaine
had this result, as shown in a two-by-two table (Table 7-6).41
Is this difference real? The null hypothesis is that there is no
association between the rows and the columns; the alternative
hypothesis is that there is an association. A variety of statis-
tical techniques allow a comparison of the TNS rate. These
include Fisher’s exact test and (.Pearson’s) chi-square test, and the
null hypothesis is rejected for this data. The chi-square test
offers the advantage of being computationally simpler; it can
also analyze contingency tables with more than two rows and
two columns; however, certain assumptions of sample size and
response rate are not achieved here, and the Fisher’s exact test
is preferred.

Statistic point estimates are presented with 95% confidence intervals.
For ratio statistics when a cell has a zero value, 0.5 is added to all cells.
The results of such experiments are often presented as an effect
size: the risk ratio (RR), the odds ratio (OR), the risk difference
(RD), and the number needed to treat or harm (NNT, NNH).42-44
In this trial, patients were much more likely to have developed
TNS when receiving lidocaine (RR — 9, OR = 11.8). With the
NNH equal to 4.6, for every four to five patients receiving lido-
caine, one additional patient would suffer TNS. RCTs concern-
ing lidocaine versus other local anesthetics for spinal anesthesia
have not necessarily found similar effect sizes. Statistical methods
of meta-analysis (MA) can synthesize effect sizes from multiple
trials to achieve greater precision and resolve inconsistencies in
reported literature (see below).
Lisi&sr Regression
Often, a goal of an experiment is to find relationships between
two variables so that in new patients the prediction of the value
of one characteristic may be made by knowledge of another char-
acteristic. The most commonly used technique for this purpose
is linear regression analysis. Experiments for this purpose col-
lect data pairs (x,, yf); these data pairs may be captured in either
clinical trials or observational studies. The y variable is called the
dependent or response variable while the x variable is denoted
the independent or explanatory variable. These data should be
displayed in a scatter plot; in the simplest type, a straight line
(linear relationship) is assumed between two variables; the y vari-
able is considered a function of the x variable. This is expressed
as the linear regression equation y = a + bx; the parameters of the
regression equation are a and b. The parameter b is the slope of
the straight line relating x and y; for each 1 unit change in x, there
are b unit changes in y. The parameter a is the intercept (value of
y when x equals 0). Estimates of the parameters are obtained from
a least squares method that sets the slope b value to minimize the
sum of the vertical distances from the data pairs to the regres-
, -x)(yi-y)
sion line: b =---—;---------—------; a = y + bx . The parameter
of greatest interest in regression is usually the slope, especially
whether the slope is nonzero; a zero-value slope implies that x
and y are not linearly related. With the additional assumption of
bivariate normality (both x and y normally distributed), a t-test
statistic is used to check the statistical significance of the slope.
The same (x,, y,) data pairs are usually subjected to correlation
analysis. The correlation coefficient r is a measure of the Unear
covariation of x and y; r ranges from —1 to 1. There is no lin-
ear correlation between x and y if r is zero valued. It is estimated
S^fxi-xXyi-y)
by r - i =. The test of the statistical
significance of r is equivalent to the test for the significance of
the regression slope b. The squared value of r known as the coef-
ficient of determination (r2) varies between 0 or 1 and is some-
times expressed as a percentage. The coefficient of determination
has a very useful interpretation: the fraction of the variation of y
explained by the variation of x.
As a hypothetical example, suppose that age and a plasma
biomarker of physical maturity are collected in 11 children.
The (Xj, y.) values recorded are (10, 8.04), (8, 6.95), (13, 7.58),
(9, 8.81), (11, 8.33), (14, 9.96), (6, 7.24), (4, 4.26), (12, 10.84),
(7, 4.82), and (5, 5.68). Neither an inspection of these values
nor of the summary statistics x — 9.00, y = 7.50, permits the
reader to detect any relationship. The calculation of the coef-
ficient of determination (r2 = 0.67) does allow the inference that
67% of the variation in the biomarker is explained by the varia-
• • 45
tion m age.
A researcher or reader should not be satisfied to see only the
statistical results of regression and correlation. The statistician
Anscombe created four hypothetical data sets to illustrate the
importance of visual inspection of data.46 Each data set has 11
paired (x,, y,) observations (Fig. 7-2). The hypothetical example
(listed above) is displayed in the upper left quadrant; a linear
relationship is illustrated. For the data in the upper right quad-
rant, the relationship between x and y is curvilinear (quadratic).
For the lower right quadrant, there is no relationship between x
and y; with one exception all data pairs have the same x value.
For the lower left quadrant, there is a near-perfect correlation
between x and y except for one data pair with a much higher y
value. Nevertheless, all summary statistics, regression and corre-
lation values of the four data sets including means, SDs, slopes,
intercepts, standard errors of regression parameters, statistical sig-
nificance of regression parameters, and correlation coefficients are
equal. There are clearly four different patterns that can only be
detected by visual inspection. Even this simplest form of regres-
sion and correlation analysis is based on the strong assumption of
an underlying linear relationship between x and y; failure of that
assumption leads to erroneous statistical inference. Using just the
summary, regression and correlation statistics, the four data sets
would have been thought to have very similar/identical under-
lying relationships. Reports of linear regression should always
include scatter plots of raw data.
Epidemiology
Epidemiology is the study of the patterns, causes, and effects of
health and disease conditions. Epidemiology is based on obser-
vations collected systematically but without the interventions
(anesthetic drugs and techniques) being allocated to patients
under experimental control. Major areas of epidemiologic study
relevant to anesthesia care are nonrandomized studies (NRSs) of
the effectiveness of anesthetic drugs and techniques on outcomes
following anesthesia and surgery, the properties of diagnostic tests
for the identification of perioperative complications, the deter-
mination of risk factors for outcomes, and the estimation of risk
prognosis models for individual predication. Systematic reviews
(SRs) and MA also come under the banner of epidemiology as
does the advent of “Big Data.”
A fundamental axiom of epidemiology' is that an “association
does not necessarily imply causation.” In 1965, the epidemiolo-
gist Bradford Hill suggested guidelines for assessing evidence of

causation when presented with an observed association between
the environment and disease.47 Fifty years later, loannidis revis-
ited these criteria, assessed which of these had worked, and
identified two: consistency and experiment.48 Of the former, Hill
offered this question “Has it (an association) been repeatedly
observed by different persons, in different places, circumstances
and times?”47 However, nothing can replace experiment. loanni-
dis reported: “Among the most highly cited papers in the bio-
medical literature, five out of six observational studies have been
‘refuted’ by subsequent randomized trials . .. .”31 Be it an RCT or
an observational study report, the results and claims of medical
research are not and should not be considered in isolation from
prior knowledge. The precision with which the P value is calcu-
lated by statistical software by itself should not replace a consid-
eration of all evidence.
Multivariable Linear Regressiisn
Regression methods can be extended to data sets in which one
response variable is linearly related to many explanatory vari-
ables. This regression includes methods for choosing which
of the explanatory variables have a statistically significant (i.e.,
nonzero) regression slope. Multivariable linear regression is the
creation of a model relating some continuous response such as
heart rate to any number of k explanatory variables; these are also
called covariates. This regression starts with data from n patients
of the form (yh xi b xl2>..., xik) where the subscript i denotes
the ith patient, y, is the response in the ith patient, x( is the value
of a covariate in the ith patient, and the second subscript of X|
denotes the 1 to k covariates. The linear model equation for the ith
individual is: = 0O + pixu + 02x,,2 + ••• + 0k*Ui = 2uj=10J*i.J •
The PjS are the unknown coefficients (parameters) of the model
that will be estimated from the observed data. For the ith indi-
vidual, the expected value of the model, |lj, is the linear sum of
each covariate value multiplied by its coefficient. The difference
between the observed (yf) and expected value (|ij) reflects biologic
variability, measurement error, and other such factors.
Univariable an&J Multivariable
Logistic Regression
If the response variable is binary (alive/dead, complication/no
complication), linear regression has been extended. Thus, there
is the typical sigmoidally shaped regression of a binary outcome
(e.g., movement) versus anesthetic dose. There are multiple meth-
ods for regression of binary outcomes, the most common being
logistic regression. The most commonly used format of the logistic
method is the multivariable logistic regression model. The response
variable y, denotes the value of the binary outcome in the ith indi-
vidual and is generally coded as 0 or 1 representing the absence
or presence of an event (e.g., day-of-surgery mortality). Letting H
represent the probability that the response variable has value 1,
then the logit transformation, log of the odds ratio = In | —ZL_ >
U-U/
allows 7C to be expressed as the linear combination of the covariates:
r n \ k
I*1 7 ~ = Po + PiXij + p2X|,2 + •■• + PkXij, = BjXij-
The logit transformation is the link function relating the sum of
the covariates to the probability of the binary outcome.
Multivariable regression is used to control for confounding.
Confounding occurs when the apparent association between a
7 Experimental Design and Statistics
covariate and an outcome is affected by the relationship of a third
variable to the covariate and to the outcome; the third variable is a
confounder. As contrasted to sequentially regressing each covari-
ate against the response variable, multivariable regression is per-
formed by simultaneously fitting all explanatory variables.49 For
example, in exploring the relationship between tobacco and myo-
cardial infarction, male sex, poverty, and sedentary lifestyle could
be confounders because they are associated with both smoking
and coronary heart disease.
Each year, thousands of reports are published in the medi-
cal literature using stepwise, multivariable logistic regression on
observational data to identify “independent” predictors for vari-
ous clinical outcomes.50 Stepwise, multivariable logistic regres-
sion is an automatic procedure where there are a large number
of potential explanatory variables and no underlying theory on
which to base the selection of prediction model risk factors.51,52
In the anesthesia literature, postoperative nausea and vomiting
has been a very common topic for such statistical modeling.53-55
Once these predictive models have been created, there is a frame-
work for assessing their performance.56-58 This mandates the
acquisition of new patients at a different time and place. There is
a widely used predictive model of sepsis in hospitalized patients
implemented in hundreds of hospitals; it was developed from a
proprietary database of over 400,000 patient encounters; it had
poor discrimination and calibration in predicting sepsis onset.59
Great skepticism should be shown for most of these prognostic
models, especially those concerning mortality and critical illness,
as they usually have not been validated, have modest accuracy,
and do not have documented clinical utility.60,61
Propensity ansU Analysis
6	Another approach for providing estimation of treatment effect in
NRSs is the methodology of propensity score matching.62,63 This
use of NRS data is intended to investigate the effect of treatment
X on a specified dichotomous outcome Y; the good outcome can
be denoted Y*, for example, survival, with Y- being the opposite.
It is usually the case that one or more baseline prognostic covari-
ates (confounders Cu C2, . . ., Ck) may be imbalanced between
the patients that did (X+) and did not (X-) receive the treat-
ment of interest. The favorable outcome, conditional on receiv-
ing treatment X+, is denoted Y+|X+ with Y+|X" being a favorable
outcome in those not receiving the treatment. Any difference
between interventions on the outcome Y may be a consequence
of the confounders influencing both the treatment and the out-
come; a failure to observe a difference in outcome may also be a
consequence of confounding. As an example, pulmonary artery
catheterization (PAG) in the care of the critically ill was adopted
about 40 years ago and widely disseminated without rigorous
evaluation. The enthusiasm of intensivists for such monitoring
even forced the cessation of an RCT comparing care with and
without PACs because of the unwillingness of physicians to allow
patient participation in the study.64 Using data of 5,735 critically
ill patients, Connors et al. reported lower 6-month survival in the
2,184 patients with PACs (Yt|X+ = 46.3% vs. Y*|X- = 53.7%), but far
more X+ patients had multiorgan system failure (MOSE: 57% vs.
35%) at die time of PAC placement; there were other imbalances
of initial covariates.65 Was the higher mortality attributable to the
use of PACs or to a greater severity of illness? Using propensity
matching, Connors created a pair of subsets (1,008 patients vs.
1,008 patients) with similar proportions of prognostic factors in
both groups (e.g., MOSF: 34%); 6-month survival was still lower
(r|X* = 46.0% vs. r|X* = 51.2%).
Propensity score matching is a statistical technique within the
general concept of matching. If only one prognostic factor was
important, for example, sex, then a pair of matched subsets could
be created easily by repeatedly and randomly placing one man
and one woman into each subset—matching the groups just by
sex. However, there is usually a great deal of baseline informa-
tion about patients observed in an NRS; Connors had details for
about 40+ baseline covariates.36 In addition, it is often not evident
which baseline characteristics are predictive of outcome. Creating
groups by simple matching is not generally possible using more
than a very few covariates.
The propensity score is defined as a subject’s probability of
receiving a specific treatment, conditional on the many baseline
covariates. The propensity score is usually estimated by multi-
variable logistic regression. In contrast to the attempt to create of
parsimonious model with a few independent predictors of out-
come by logistic regression modeling of NRS data, all available
covariates are left in the model for a propensity score, regardless
of whether they are statistically significant. These covariates must
be restricted to those that are known prior to the intervention. In
the study by Connors, the presence/absence of MOSF on hospi-
tal admission should be included in the propensity score; MOSF
developing a week later should not.
For each patient in the data set, the z score obtained from the
sum of each covariate times its regression coefficient is calculated:
Z = Po + PiCij + PiCi.2 +----F phCi.h = ^J=1PjQ.j- Taking the
antilogit of the z score J yields the probability that
a patient with those covariate values received the intervention.
Of course, it is in fact known whether or not a patient received
the intervention. Propensity-matched subsets of patients are cre-
ated by randomly choosing and matching one patient receiving
the intervention to one patient not receiving the intervention
with the same probability from the z score; usually, the propen-
sity probabilities (scores) are matched to the third or greater deci-
mal place. The success of propensity score matching in balancing
many covariates was well displayed in an observational compari-
son of epidural anesthesia for intermediate- to high-risk noncar-
diac surgery by Wijeysundera et al.66 As graphed by Gayat et al.
(Fig. 7-3), 45 baseline characteristics of two matched subsets of
about 44,000 patients each became extremely well balanced.67 In
the original data set, an arterial line was used in 59% versus 33%;
after balancing, an arterial line was used in 48% for both. The
total of patients in the two matched subsets will always be less
than the total count of patients in the NRS data set; some patients
can’t be matched. Simple paired statistics are used to compare the
outcomes of the two subsets.
Propensity score methods are being used in NRSs to reduce
the effect of selection bias in estimating causal treatment effects.
Besides propensity score matching, the effect of selection bias
can also be reduced by using propensity scores for stratification,
regression adjustment, and weighting. It is now routine to see
NRS using propensity analysis in the intensive care and anesthesia
literature—most commonly using matching. A propensity score
matching analysis should include (1) details of propensity score
building; (2) matching method; and (3) demonstration of covari-
ate balancing by tabular or graphical display.38 The propensity
score can reduce bias due to observed covariates.
As useful as they are, propensity score methods cannot replace
the RCT, since randomization minimizes covariate imbalance
between treatment groups for observed, unobserved, and unob-
servable covariates. In 2007, Murphy et al. reported outcomes fol-
lowing cardiac surgery using a database of operations on about
8,700 patients; propensity scores estimated from preoperative risk
factors and intraoperative events were used to adjust all statistical
comparisons for this potential confounding.68 Mortality, morbidity,

Standardized difference
repre/entati°n of 45 baseliPe “variates before and after propensity score matching using data from Wiieysundera et al.66
The standardized difference for each covariate is the average difference between groups divided bv the averaoe standard deviation of th? two
groups. The standardized difference increases directly with increasing imbalance between groups. With propenstyscore matching the standardized
difference is dose to zero for all covariates. (Reprinted from Gayat E, Pirracchio R, Resche-Rigon M, et al. Propensscores h intense care and anaes
thesiology literature: a systematic review. Intensive Care Medicine. 2010;36; 1997 67 With kind permission from ^pdnger ScLS
and cost of care was increased in patients receiving blood. In
2015, Murphy et al. reported the 2,000-patient TITRe2 trial with
the hypothesis that a restrictive threshold for red-cell transfusion
would reduce postoperative morbidity.69 There was no difference
by transfusion strategy in the primary, composite outcome (seri-
ous infections or ischemic events); indeed, mortality was higher
(4.2% vs. 2.6%) at 3 months in the restrictive-threshold group.
The authors concluded: “The difference is probably due to the
fact that observational analyses are confounded by prognostic
factors that influence the decision to transfuse red cells.” Even a
well-conducted, propensity-adjusted analysis cannot remove con-
founding for unobserved or unobservable covariates.
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
, 7; It is over 30 years since the first systematic review (SR) with an
accompanying meta-analysis (MA) was published in an anesthesia
journal70 and reports using these research methods are now
commonplace in anesthesia journals.71-73 The focused question
of an SR of interventions can subsumed by the acronym PI
P = Population, I = Intervention, C = Comparison, and O = Out
come. The structured title of an SR usually contains most of t e
PICO elements. .
Data are obtained from controlled trials (usually randomize
already in the medical literature rather than from newly conducte
clinical trials; the basic unit of analysis of this observations
research is the published study. A structured protocol is followe
that includes in part (1) choice of study inclusion/exclusion cn
teria; (2) explicitly defined literature searching; (3) abstraction o
data from included studies; (4) appraisal of risk bias within eac
study; (5) systematic pooling of data; and (6) discussion of in
ences. This structured protocol is intended to minimize bias. Eve
RCTs may have sources of bias such as (1) selection bias: system
atic differences between the patients receiving each intervention,
7 Experimental Design and Statistics
(2) performance bias: systematic differences in care being given
to study patients other than the preplanned interventions being
evaluated; (3) attrition bias: systematic differences in the with-
drawal of patients from each of the two intervention groups; and
(4) detection bias: systematic differences in the ascertainment and
recording of outcomes. The main focus of bias detection in the
trials incorporated into an SR is the (1) randomization process;
(2) concealment of random allocation; (3) use of blinding; and
(4) the reporting/analysis of dropouts.
Binary outcomes (yes/no, alive/dead, presence/absence) within
a study are usually compared by the risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio
(OR) effect size; for continuous variables, the effect size is the
mean difference. If there is sufficient clinical similarity among
the included studies, a summary value of the overall effect size of
the intervention versus comparison treatments is estimated by MA.
MA is a set of statistical techniques for combining results from dif-
ferent studies. The results of an MA are usually present in a figure
called a Forest plot (Fig. 7-4). The far left column identifies the
included studies; the center-left columns display the observed data.
The center-right columns list the RRs with 95% Cis for the indi-
vidual studies and the summary statistics. The horizontal lines and
diamond shapes in the figures of the far right column are graphical
representations of individual study RR and summary RR, respec-
tively. There are also descriptive and inferential statistics concern-
ing the statistical heterogeneity of the MA and the significance of
the summary statistics. Interestingly, it has been noted that the ini-
tial estimates of benefit in an SR are generally inflated when com-
pared to the effect size estimated when the SR is later updated.74
An examination of Figure 7-4 shows that 11 of 15 individual
comparisons had wide, nonsignificant Cis that touched or crossed
the RR of identity (RR = 1). However, the overall consistency of
effect is easily seen with lidocaine being “favored” in only one
study. The RR calculated from all studies was 7.31 with a 95% CI
[4.16, 12.86]. In this example, the power of summary statistics to
combine evidence is clear. About every seventh patient (92/637)
who had a lidocaine spinal block had TNS; the risk of TNS was
about seven times higher compared to other local anesthetics.75
The production of SRs comes from several sources. Many
come from the individual initiative of researchers who publish
their results as stand-alone reports in the journals of medicine
and anesthesia. The American Society of Anesthesiologists has
developed a process for the creation of practice parameters that
includes, among other things, a variant form of SRs. A prominent
proponent of SRs is the Cochrane Collaboration: an international
network of more than 30,000 volunteers from over 100 countries
that have published about 9,000 SRs online in The Cochrane
Library." An SR should be considered provisional, an update with
new evidence always being possible. One distinction between
Cochrane and non-Cochrane SRs is the updating of Cochrane
SRs periodically as new research reports become available; for
example, the SR concerning TNS has been recently updated.76
Methods for MA continue to be refined to include multiple treat-
ment comparisons,77 diagnostic tests,78,79 the use of random
effects models,80 trial sequential analysis to maintain the Type I
error rate with MA updating,81 and many approaches to statistical
heterogeneity. The R statistical platform offers over 50 packages
to estimate and display MAs.b The Cochrane Collaboration has
extensive documentation, tutorials, and software available that
electronically explains the techniques of SRs and MA.C

Big Data
Big Data has the attributes of the three “V”s (Volume, Velocity, and 8
Variety). How big is Big Data? The volume usually cited is billions
of records produced at a velocity of millions each day encompass-
ing many variable types. The computer storage of Big Data requires
a new nomenclature beyond gigabyte (GB) and terabyte: petabyte =
106 GBs; exabyte = 109 GBs; and even higher. Big Data can be also
defined to include studies that required new approaches to the col-
lection, management, and analysis of data beyond those commonly
used or available; historically, two epidemiology reports in anes-
thesia published 50 or more years ago can claim inclusion within
Big Data. The first was a 5-year (1948 to 1952) study of all postop-
erative deaths following about 600,000 anesthetics at 10 academic
medical centers distributed across the United States.82 The other
was the National Halothane Study that reported the rate of deaths
and fatal hepatic necrosis during 4 years (1959 to 1962) following
about 850,000 anesthetics at 34 hospitals.83 Both studies required
a scaling up of resources for data collection and management and
both included new statistical methods.
What does Big Data promise? Messages posted to social media
and inquiries on web search engines tally in the millions each day.
The logs of this activity have been called the digital exhaust of our
age. Is there usable health content therein? Authors from the search
engine company Google reported that by tallying search topics, for
example, “cold/flu remedy” or “Influenza complication,” this social
media data predicted accurately influenza flu trends across several
years of flu epidemics; these predictions mirrored official health sta-
tistics of the rise and fall of infections.84 It was proposed that by har-
nessing the collective intelligence of millions of users, even faster
surveillance of disease activity was possible. A more skeptical reex-
amination of these social media models found them not sufficient
to replace timely local and national surveillance of health trends.83
Whither goes Big Data in anesthesia and pain care?86459 There
is much use of institutional and governmental administrative and
billing databases in epidemiology reports of anesthesia. And there
are now several national repositories of perioperative data including
the National Clinical Outcomes Registry (NACOR), the Multicenter
Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), the National Surgery Qual-
ity Program (NSQIP), and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National
Database.88 While all have millions of patient records, only MPOG
routinely captures all physiologic monitoring data at 5-minute or
more frequent intervals. Even with this perioperative data, no repos-
itory or administrative database meets the definition of Big Data.
The routine digitation of waveforms (e.g., electrocardiogram) at
high resolution with storage in a national repository would quickly
create Big Data.90,91 The use of prospective genotyping of patients
prior to anesthesia and surgery would also create Big Data.88,92 Until
then, Big Data does not yet apply to anesthesia research.
Conclusions
interpretation of Results
Scientific studies do not end with the statistical test.93 Whether
the primary outcome of a new treatment succeeds or fails, the
experimenter must submit an opinion as to the generalizability of
their work to the rest of the world.94,95 Even if there is a statisti-
cally significant difference, the experimenter must decide if this
difference is medically or physiologically important. Statistical
significance does not always equate with biologic or clinical rele-
vance. The questions an experimenter should ask about the inter-
pretation of results are highly dependent on the specifics of the
experiment. First, even small, clinically unimportant differences

Figure 7-4 A Forest plot illustrates the relative strength of treatment effect across multiple studies The point estimate for each study is repre"
sented by a square with 95% Cis represented by horizontal lines. In a Forest plot of RRs or ORs, the x-axis of the graph is on a logarithmic scale so
that Cis are symmetrical about the point estimate. The vertical line of no effect is at 1. The area of each square is proportional to the weight of that
study in the summary RR. The summary RRs are diamonds whose lateral points indicate the 95% Cl of the summary value. (Reprinted by permission

7 Experimental Design and Statistics
between groups can be detected if the sample size is sufficiently
large. On the other hand, if the sample size is small, one must
always worry that identified or unidentified confounding vari-
ables may explain any difference; as the sample size decreases,
randomization is less successful in assuring homogenous groups.
Second, if the experimental groups are given three or more doses
of a drug, do the results suggest a steadily increasing or decreas-
ing dose-response relationship? Suppose the observed effect for an
intermediate dose is either much higher or much lower than that
for both the highest and lowest dose; a dose-response relationship
may exist, but some skepticism about the experimental methods
is warranted. Third, for clinical studies comparing different drugs,
devices, and operations on patient outcome, are the patients, clini-
cal care, and studied therapies sufficiently similar to those provided
at other locations to be of interest to a wide group of practitioners?
This is the distinction between efficacy—does it work under the
best (research) circumstances—and effectiveness—does it work
under the typical circumstances of routine clinical care?
Finally, in comparing alternative therapies, the confidence that
a claim for a superior therapy is true depends on the study design.
The strength of the evidence concerning efficacy will be least for
an anecdotal case report; next in importance will be a retrospec-
tive study, then a prospective series of patients compared with his-
torical controls, and finally a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
The greatest strength for a therapeutic claim is a series of random-
ized, controlled clinical trials confirming the same hypothesis.
Statist/ca/
Accompanying the exponential growth of medical information
has been the creation of a wealth of biostatistical knowledge. The
increased emphasis on evidence-based medicine creates a great
need for educating future and current physicians in quantitative
reasoning, probability, and statistics. Textbooks oriented toward
medical statistics and with expositions of basic, intermediate, and
advanced statistics abound. There are journals of biomedical statis-
tics, including Epidemiology, Research Synthesis Methods, Systematic
Reviews, Statistics in Medicine, and Statistical Methods in Medical
Research, whose audiences are both statisticians and biomedical
researchers. Some medical journals, for example, the British Medi-
cal foumal, fAMA, New England foumal of Medicine, regularly
publish expositions of both basic and newer advanced statistical
methods. Journals of anesthesia including Anesthesiology and Anes-
thesia & Analgesia now frequently publish details of research design
and statistical methods. Extensive internet resources including free
online courses on data analysis methods, electronic textbooks of
basic statistical methods, online statistical calculators, standard
data sets, and reviews of statistical software can be easily found.
High-performance statistical software is freely available from the
R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria/ There is
continuing expansion in the resources giving guidance in method-
ology. Much of the improvement has been driven by epidemiologists
and statisticians associated with the Cochrane Collaboration^ and
the Equator (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health
Research) network. There is a centralized resource for obtaining
these and other reporting guidelines at the Equator network that
includes over 500 entries/ Another resource is the GRADE (Grad-
9 ing of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalua-
tion) working group that develops methods to rate the certainty of
evidence and strength of recommendations in SRs.g

Statistics and Anesthesia
Academic anesthesia needs more individuals well trained in sta-
tistical fundamentals. Statistically knowledgeable academic anes-
thesiologists will be positioned not only to improve their own
research projects, but also to assist their colleagues, to strengthen
the editorial review of journal manuscripts, and to know when
to seek guidance from a professional statistician. Readers of the
clinical literature should also expand their effort to acquire basic
statistical skills, as journals are increasingly difficult to under-
stand without basic statistical knowledge. Finally, understanding
principles of experimental design and statistical inference can pre-
vent premature acceptances of new therapies from faulty studies.

Summary

1 The most crucial component of infection prevention is frequent and effective hand hygiene. Wearing gloves does
not reduce the need for hand hygiene.
2	The ideal hand hygiene agent kills a broad spectrum of microbes, has antimicrobial activity that persists for at least
6	hours after application, is simple to use, and has few side effects.
3	There is no compelling evidence that single-use disposables reduce infections, except where adequate disinfection
is not (currently) possible (e.g., vascular catheters, duodenoscopes). While the cost of acquisition is lower for
disposables, the per-use cost is almost always orders of magnitude greater. In addition, life-cycle analyses have
shown that disposables cause demonstrable public health harm (in the range of that caused by medical errors) by
increasing waste, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, offsetting any theoretical protection from infection.
4	Antibiotic prophylaxis has become standard for surgeries in which there is more than a minimum risk of infection.
The most commonly used antibiotic for surgical prophylaxis is cefazolin, a first-generation cephalosporin, as the
potential pathogens for most surgeries are gram-positive cocci from the skin.
5	The exact timing for the administration of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis depends on the pharmacology and half-
life of the drug, but should generally be 0 to 60 minutes before incision. Anesthesiologists should work in consultation
with surgeons to take initiative for administering prophylactic antibiotics because they have access to the patient
during the 60 minutes prior to incision and can optimize timing of administration.
6	The standard teaching that oxygen delivery depends more on hemoglobin-bound oxygen (oxygen content) than on
arterial PO2 may be true for working muscle, but it is not true for wound healing. Although oxygen consumption is
relatively low in wounds, it is consumed by processes that require oxygen at a high concentration. Delivery of oxygen
to wounds depends on arterial PO2 rather than hemoglobin-bound oxygen (oxygen content).
7	Peripheral vasoconstriction, which results from central sympathetic control of subcutaneous vascular tone, is probably
the most frequent and clinically the most important impediment to wound oxygenation and wound healing. All
vasoconstrictive stimuli must be corrected simultaneously to allow optimal healing. Modifiable risks for wound
infections include smoking, malnutrition, obesity, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. These
should be assessed and corrected (when possible) prior to surgery.
8	Prevention or correction of hypothermia has been shown to decrease wound infections and increase collagen
deposition in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Maintenance of a high room temperature or active
warming before, during, and after the operation is significantly more effective than other methods of warming,
such as application of warmed blankets, circulating water blankets placed on the surface of the operating table,
and humidification of the breathing circuit.
9	Optimizing the volume of perioperative fluid administration to minimize morbidity and mortality remains a significant
and controversial challenge. Current best recommendations for volume management include replacing fluid losses
based on standard recommendations for the type of surgery, replacement of blood loss, and replacement of other
ongoing fluid losses (e.g., high urine output due to diuretic or dye administration, hyperglycemia, or thermoregula-
tory vasoconstriction).
10	Administration of supplemental oxygen via face mask or nasal cannula increases safety in patients receiving systemic
opioids. As a side benefit, it may also improve wound healing. Pain control also appears important since it favorably
influences both pulmonary function and vascular tone.
11	In patients with moderate to high risk of surgical site infection, anesthesiologists have the opportunity to enhance
wound healing and reduce the incidence of wound infections by simple, inexpensive, and readily available means.

Introduction
Despite major advances in the management of patients undergo-
ing surgery—including aseptic technique, prophylactic antibi-
otics, and advances in surgical approaches such as laparoscopic
surgery—surgical site infection (SSI) and wound failure remain
common complications of surgery (Table 8-1).* 1 SSIs account for
about 20% of health care-associated infections are associated with
prolonged hospitalization (-10 days) and mortality, and an annual
cost of about $3 billion.1 In recent years, focused efforts have had
some measure of success. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) estimates that the rate of health care-associated
infections in surgical patients decreased from 4% in 2011 to
3.2% in 2015.1 A primary driver is the reduction in SSIs and uri-
nary tract infections.2 3 4 While reducing bacterial contamination
has been the primary focus of SSI prevention efforts, a growing
body of literature supports the concept that patient factors are
also a major determinant of wound outcome following surgery.

8 Inflammation, Wound Healing, and Infection
Comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiac disease clearly con-
tribute; a patient’s genetic make-up may also have a role? In
addition, environmental stressors and the individual response to
stress are important. In particular, wounds are exquisitely sensi-
tive to hypoxia, which is both common and preventable. Peri-
operative management can be adapted to promote postoperative
wound healing and resistance to infection. Along with aseptic
technique and prophylactic antibiotics, maintaining perfusion
and oxygenation of the wound is paramount. This chapter dis-
cusses how knowledge of the principles of infection control and
the physiology of wound repair and resistance to infection can
improve outcomes.
Infection C©ntiro0
1 The most crucial component of infection prevention is frequent
and effective hand hygiene. In 1847, Ignaz Semmelweis made
the observation that women who delivered their babies in the
First Clinic at the General Hospital of Vienna, staffed by medi-
cal students and physicians, had a mortality rate of 5% to 15%,
largely the result of puerperal infections; this was substantially
higher than the 2% rate of women who delivered at Clinic 2,
which was staffed by midwife students and midwives? Students
and physicians at Clinic 1 usually started the day performing
autopsies (including on patients who died of puerperal fever)
and then moved on to the clinic, where they performed examina-
tions on women in labor. Semmelweis made the connection, and
although germ theory was some years off, he insisted that phy-
sicians and medical students wash their hands in a chlorinated
solution when leaving the pathology laboratory. This reduced the
rate of puerperal fever to the same rate as at Clinic 2. Soon, Sem-
melweis identified cases of transmission from an infected to an
uninfected patient and instituted the use of chlorinated solution
hand washing between cases as well. He also demonstrated that
the chlorinated solution was more effective than soap and water.
Unfortunately, his innovation was not widely adopted, resulting
from a combination of factors, including delay in publishing his
results, reluctance of his colleagues to accept that they might be
responsible for transmitting disease, and his lower social standing
as a Hungarian living in the Austrian Empire. Despite our current
knowledge of germ theory, hand hygiene remains an inexplicably
neglected component of infection control. Studies consistently
demonstrate about a 40% rate of adherence (range, 5% to 81%) to
hand hygiene guidelines? and compliance by anesthesiologists in
the operating room (OR) is notably lower?
Bacteria are resident in the skin and can never be completely
eliminated? Resident flora are embedded in the deeper folds of the
skin and are more resistant to removal, but are also infrequently
pathogenic. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and diphtheroids
are the most common. Transient flora colonizes the superficial
layers of the skin and thus are easier to remove with hand hygiene.
Transient flora is also the source of most health care-associated
infections, as health care worker’s skin can become contaminated
from patient contact or contact with contaminated surfaces.
Contamination from surfaces is most common with organisms
such as staphylococci and enterococci, both of which are resis-
tant to drying. Even “clean” activities such as taking a patient’s
pulse or applying monitors can lead to hand contamination. In
one study, 100 to 1,000 colony-forming units of Klebsiella species
were measured on nurses’ hands following such activities? No
studies have related hand contamination to actual transmission
of infection to patients; however, numerous studies, starting with
those of Semmelweis, have demonstrated a reduction in health
care-associated infections following institution of hand hygiene
or improved adherence to hand hygiene?
A number of products are available for hand hygiene. The ideal 2
agent kills a broad spectrum of microbes, has antimicrobial activ-
ity that persists for at least 6 hours after application, is simple to
use, and has few side effects.
Plain (not antiseptic) soap and water are generally the least
effective at reducing hand contamination? Although obvious dirt
is removed by the detergent effect of soap and the mechanical
action of washing, bacterial load is not gready reduced. Further,
soap and water hand hygiene is associated with high rates of
skin irritation and drying, both of which are risk factors for an
increased bacterial load. Soap and water are, however, the most
effective at removing spores, and, therefore, should be used when
contamination with Clostridium difficile or Bacillus anthracis is
a concern?
The antimicrobial activity of alcohol-based rinses, gels, and
foams comes from their ability to denature proteins? Ethanol is
most commonly used because it has more antiviral activity than
isopropanol. Antiseptics containing 60% to 95% ethanol with a
water base are germicidal and effective against gram-positive and
gram-negative bacteria, lipophilic viruses such as herpes sim-
plex, human immunodeficiency, influenza, respiratory syncytial,
and vaccinia viruses, and hepatitis B and C viruses. They have
little persistent activity, although regrowth of bacteria does occur
slowly after use of alcohol-based products. Combination with low
doses of other agents such as chlorhexidine, quaternary ammo-
nium compounds, or triclosan can confer persistent activity. Effi-
cacy depends on volume applied (3 mL is superior to 1 mL) and
duration of contact (ideally, 30 seconds).
Chlorhexidine is a cationic bisbiguanide that disrupts cytoplas-
mic membranes, resulting in precipitation of cellular contents? It
is germicidal against gram-positive bacteria and lipophilic viruses,
with somewhat less activity against gram-negative bacteria and
fungi and minimal activity against tubercle bacilli. It has substan-
tial persistence on the skin. The CDC has identified chlorhexidine
as the topical agent of choice. It may cause severe corneal dam-
age after direct contact with the eye, ototoxicity after direct con-
tact with the inner or middle ear, and neurotoxicity after direct
contact with the brain or meninges. There are reports of bacteria
that have acquired reduced susceptibility to chlorhexidine, but
these are of questionable clinical relevance since the concentra-
tions at which resistance was found were substantially lower than
that of commercially available products. An additional disadvan-
tage is the risk of immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic reactions
to chlorhexidine.7 Cases are likely underreported because of the
difficulty identifying the source of anaphylactic reactions peri-
operatively. Chlorhexidine is present in a wide range of medical
and community-based products, including wipes, impregnated
central venous catheters, toothpaste, mouthwash, contact lens
cleanser, and food preservatives. Therefore, potentially sensitizing
exposures are common.
Iodine and iodophors (iodine with a polymer carrier) pen-
etrate the cell wall and impair protein synthesis and cell mem-
brane function? They are bactericidal against gram-positive,
gram-negative, and some spore-forming bacteria including Clos-
tridia and Bacillus species; they are inactive against spores. They
also have activity against mycobacteria, viruses, and fungi. Their
persistence is relatively poor. They cause more contact dermatitis
than other commonly used agents, and allergies to this class of
topical agent are common. Iodophors generally cause fewer side
effects than iodine agents.
The choice of an antiseptic depends on the expected patho-
gens, acceptability by health care workers, and cost. In general.

Table 8-2 Indications for Hand Hygiene
When hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with proteinaceous material or are visibly soiled with blood or other body fluids, wash
hands with either a nonantimicrobial soap and water or an antimicrobial soap and water._______________________________________
If hands are not visibly soiled, use an alcohol-based hand rub for routinely decontaminating hands. Alternatively, wash hands with an
antimicrobial soap and water. _____________________________________________________________________
Decontaminate hands before having direct contact with patients.____________________________
Decontaminate hands before donning sterile gloves when inserting a central intravascular catheter.
Decontaminate hands before inserting indwelling urinary catheters, peripheral vascular catheters, or other invasive devices that do not
require a surgical procedure. ___________________________________________________________
Decontaminate hands after contact with a patient's intact skin (e.g., applying monitors, moving patient).
Decontaminate hands after contact with body fluids or excretions, mucous membranes, nonintact skin, and wound dressings if hands
are not visibly soiled.
Decontaminate hands if moving from a contaminated-body site (e.g., mouth during tracheal intubation) to a clean-body site (e.g., adjusting
gas flow, turning on ventilator, starting IV) during patient care.
Decontaminate hands after contact with inanimate objects (including medical equipment) in the immediate vicinity of the patient. Take
care to reduce contamination of the anesthesia machine (e.g., after tracheal intubation) as well!
Decontaminate hands after removing gloves.
Before eating and after using a restroom, wash hands with a nonantimicrobial soap and water or with an antimicrobial soap
and water.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Antimicrobial-impregnated wipes (i.e., towelettes) may be considered as an alternative to washing hands with nonantimicrobial
soap and water. Because they are not as effective as alcohol-based hand rubs or washing hands with an antimicrobial soap and
water for reducing bacterial counts on the hands of HCWs, they are not a substitute for using an alcohol-based hand rub or
antimicrobial soap.

antiseptics cost about $1 per patient day, far less than the cost of
health care-associated infections. In nine studies that examined
the effect of improved hand hygiene adherence on health care-
associated infections, the majority demonstrated that as hand
hygiene practices improved, infection rates decreased.6
Barriers to hand hygiene include skin irritation and fear of skin
irritation, inaccessibility, time, and health care worker acceptance
(largely related to the other factors mentioned). Although alcohol-
based agents have long been believed to cause more skin irritation,
several recent trials have demonstrated less skin irritation and
better acceptance with emollient-containing, alcohol-based hand
rubs compared with either antimicrobial or nonantimicrobial
soaps. The use of appropriate (glove-compatible) lotions twice a
day also reduces skin irritation, leading to a 50% increase in hand
hygiene frequency in one study.6 Alcohol-based gels and foams
are also generally more accessible than antiseptic soap and water,
as the dispenser may be pocket-sized or placed conveniently near
sites of patient care. It has been estimated that alcohol-based gels
and foams require only about 25% of the time of going to a sink
to wash one’s hands. However, soap and water should be used to
remove particulate matter including blood and other body fluids
or after 5 to 10 applications of an alcohol-based agent.
Adherence to hand hygiene guidelines (Tables 8-2 to 8-4)
generally decreases as the frequency of indicated hand washing
increases, as the workload increases, and as staffing decreases.

When decontaminating hands with an alcohol-based hand
rub, apply the recommended volume of product to the palm
of one hand and rub hands together, covering all surfaces of
hands and fingers, until hands are dry.
When washing hands with soap and water, wet hands first
with water, apply an amount of the product recommended
by the manufacturer to hands, and rub hands together
vigorously for at least 15 s, covering all surfaces of the hands
and fingers. Rinse hands with water and dry thoroughly with
a disposable towel. Use towel to turn off the faucet. Avoid
using hot water because repeated exposure to hot water may
increase the risk of dermatitis.

on hand hygiene prior to entering and after leaving a patient
room. More recently, the World Health Organization has devel-
oped a campaign highlighting the “5 Moments” of hand hygiene
(Fig. 8-1 AB). The campaign emphasizes the need to perform
hand hygiene after each contact with a patient or their immediate
environment.8
In an intensive care unit (ICU), hand hygiene for nurses is
generally indicated about 20 times per hour, as compared with
lower acuity units, where this number decreases to 8 times per
hour.6 In the OR, frequent patient contact by the anesthesiolo-
gist requires frequent hand hygiene, probably at about the level of
nurses in the ICU, while accessibility to the resources necessary
to perform hand hygiene is often quite limited. Sinks are available
only outside the OR. Therefore, alcohol-based agents should be
available within hand’s reach of the anesthesia machine.
Patients, anesthetists, and environmental reservoirs (e.g., anes-
thesia work area), all contribute to cross-transmission of pathogens
responsible for health care-associated infections.9 Hand hygiene
by anesthetists and attention to bacterial decontamination of the
anesthesia work area (e.g., during and after induction) are central
to preventing SSI and other perioperative health care-associated
infections.9 Koff et al.5 demonstrated that increased hand hygiene
episodes (7 to 9 per hour compared to <0.5 per hour during the
control period) triggered by an alarm and encouraged by educa-
tion decreased work area contamination, decreased intravenous
stopcock contamination from 32% to 8%, and decreased health
care-associated infections significantly, even though opportuni-
ties were not measured and hand hygiene episodes were not nec-
essarily coordinated with one of the 5 Moments. Implementation
of a bundle that included patient decolonization, hand hygiene,
segregation of contaminated equipment and wiping down the
anesthesia workspace after induction, clean handling of syringes,
and disinfection of intravenous ports before injection reduced
cross-transmission and health care-associated infections.9 Thus,
transmission of bacterial contamination by the anesthesia pro-
vider appears to be common, a potential source of nosocomial
infections, and largely preventable.
Wearing gloves does not reduce the need for hand hygiene.
Although gloves provide protection, bacterial flora from patients
may be cultured from up to 30% of health care workers who wear
gloves during patient contact.6 Therefore, hand hygiene should
be practiced both before putting on gloves and immediately after
their removal. Moreover, gloves should be removed or changed
immediately after each procedure, including vascular access,
intubation, and neuraxial anesthesia, because gloves become con-
taminated by patient contact just as hands do. Balancing hand
hygiene with close attention to the patient during critical portions
of the case (e.g., securing the airway) can be challenging. Double
gloving and providing a convenient location for contaminated
equipment have been suggested as effective approaches.10,11 Dur-
ing high-acuity care, another approach is to apply hand hygiene
direcdy to the gloves, which is substantially faster than changing
gloves, but protects the workspace and patient environment from
cross-contamination.12
Artificial and long fingernails, as well as chipped fingernail pol-
ish, are associated with higher concentrations of bacteria on the
hands of health care workers. Artificial nails have been identified
as a source in several hospital-associated outbreaks of infection
with gram-negative bacilli and yeast. CDC guidelines discourage
the wearing of artificial nails by health care workers in high-risk
settings (e.g., the OR), and many hospitals have banned the wear-
ing of artificial nails by any employee who has direct patient con-
tact.6 It may also be appropriate to counsel patients scheduled for
surgery that artificial nails may increase their risk of infection,
although this has not been investigated. Large quantities of bac-
teria are typically trapped under the fingernails. The 2002 CDC
guidelines recommend that health care workers keep their nail
tips trimmed to less than % inch.6
Bacteria may be cultured at higher concentrations from the
skin beneath a ring. On the other hand, wearing a ring does not
increase overall bacterial levels measured on the hands of health
care workers. Therefore, it remains unclear whether transmission
of infection could be reduced by prohibiting health care workers
from wearing rings.6
Ant/seps/s
Masks have long been advocated as preventing SSIs and are used
almost universally in ORs in the United States. Tunevall13 studied
the rate of wound infections in 3,088 patients over 115 weeks.
In alternating weeks, OR personnel either wore masks or did not
(personnel with active respiratory infections continued to wear
masks). There was no difference in the rate of surgical wound
infections (4.7% vs. 3.5%, respectively) in the two groups, nor
in bacterial species cultured from the wounds. Friberg et al.14
demonstrated comparable air and surface contamination during
sham surgery in a simluated OR with horizontal laminar flow air
exchange, whether OR personnel wore a nonsterile hood and mask
or a sterilized helmet aspirator system. However, when the head
cover, but not the mask, was omitted, contamination increased
three- to fivefold. These data suggest that wearing a head cover
is useful for preventing SSI, while wearing a mask is not. None-
theless, the study by Tunevall is a small one, and most hospitals
continue to require a mask in the OR while surgical instruments
are open. Moreover, the mask does serve the purpose of protect-
ing the health care provider, particularly when combined with eye
protection, and thus should most likely be used during tracheal
intubation, emergence from anesthesia, and at other times when
exposure to body fluids is likely. The value of masks (especially
respirator masks like N95s) in protecting health care workers has
been highlighted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Although the preponderance of postoperative surgical infec-
tions is caused by flora that are endogenous to the patient, envi-
ronmental and airborne contaminants may also play a causative
role. An important, but frequendy overlooked, consideration is
the role that traffic patterns into an OR can play in patient expo-
sure to airborne organisms, although the importance of this fac-
tor may have been reduced by improved ventilation and a higher
requirement for air changes in the OR in recent years. Current
recommended practices are to limit the flow of people through an
OR that is in use, and that no more people than necessary should

be in an OR during a procedure.2 The anesthesiologist is clearly
in a position to play a leadership role in controlling human traffic
through the OR.
Central venous lines placed by the anesthesiologist in the
OR have been shown to become infected more often than those
placed by surgeons or other providers, whether in or out of the
OR. Contributing factors appeared to be site of placement and
the stringency of aseptic technique. Infection risk is significandy
higher with femoral or jugular site selection as compared to sub-
clavian placement; however, subclavian placement does have a
higher associated rate of pneumothorax. Chlorhexidine-alcohol
skin preparation results in a lower rate of central venous catheter-
associated bloodstream infection than povidone-iodine with alco-
hol and should be used preferentially. Use of a maximal sterile
barrier technique versus sterile gloves and small sterile drapes
significantly reduces central venous catheter-related infection.
Therefore, gowning and gloving, careful aseptic technique, and
use of a wide sterile field should be routine. Use of ultrasound
guidance for placement is not associated with an increased
infection rate, and therefore is recommended since it decreases
mechanical complications during placement. In anesthetized
patients, the central fine is ideally placed before the surgical site is
draped in order to avoid contamination of the wire on the under-
side of the surgical drape.15
Epidural abscess formation is an extremely rare but poten-
tially catastrophic complication of neuraxial anesthesia and epi-
dural catheter placement. Therefore, careful attention to aseptic
technique and infection control is required. The most important
consideration is to prevent contamination of the needle and cath-
eter. Thus, hand washing, skin preparation, draping, and main-
tenance of a sterile field should be carefully observed. Gowning
and wearing a mask likely play a smaller role but are reasonable,
given the devastating consequences of infection. Finally, epidur-
als should probably be avoided in patients known or suspected to
have bacteremia or deferred until after appropriate antibiotics are
administered.
of Single-Use Disposables
in Infection Control
Single-use disposable devices including noninvasive blood pres-
sure cuffs, laryngoscopes, and textiles (e.g., gowns, drapes, scrub
hats, and jackets) have proliferated in health care because of a
misperception of reduced infection risk and reduced cost.
There is no compelling evidence that single-use disposables 3
reduce infections, except where adequate disinfection is not
(currendy) possible (e.g., vascular catheters, duodenoscopes).
While the cost of acquisition is lower for disposables, the per-use
cost is almost always orders of magnitude greater. In addition,
life-cycle analyses have shown that disposables and cause demon-
strable public health harm (in the range of that caused by medical
errors) by increasing waste, pollution, and greenhouse gas emis-
sions, offsetting any theoretical protection from infection.16
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic disrupted the supply chain for
single-use disposables and provided opportunities to assess the
impact of reusables on infection rates. Malhotra et al. compared
SSI rates reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network17 at
a single institution in the 2 years preceding the pandemic with
those in the first 12 months of the pandemic. Supply chain issues
led to replacement of disposable shoe covers, head covers, and
face masks with reusable versions. This change was associated
with a reduction in SSI rate from 5.1% to 2.6%, despite a 14%
increase in surgical volume and the number of higher-risk cases.
Of particular note, at the same time, audited hand hygiene com-
pliance increased from 71% to 85%. It is likely that the bulk of
the benefit came from increased attention to infection prevention
measures in general; nonetheless, the study is reassuring that
reusable textiles do not increase the risk of infection.17
Antibiotic Prophylaxis
After antibiotics came into widespread use in the 1940s and 1950s,
there was much debate over the possibility that antibiotic prophy-
laxis might prevent SSIs. In 1957, Miles et al.18 used a guinea pig
model for proof of the principle that administration of an anti-
biotic prior to contamination (incision) could reduce the risk
of SSI. When appropriate antibiotics were given within 2 hours
before or after intradermal injection of bacteria, they were effec-
tive in preventing invasive infection and necrosis. When given
outside this window, they were not effective. This gave rise to the
concept of a “decisive period” in which antibiotics will be effec-
tive, which remains a guiding principle of antibiotic prophylaxis.
Miles et al. also demonstrated that injection of epinephrine intra-
dermally prior to administration of antibiotics led to antibiotic
failure, as demonstrated by an increased wound infection rate.
This demonstrated the crucial role of local perfusion in delivering
antibiotics to their target site. Using the same model, Knighton
et al.19 demonstrated that increased inspired oxygen was equally
as effective as antibiotics in preventing infection, and that the two
effects were additive (Fig. 8-2). Knighton et al.20 also delayed the
administration of oxygen for up to 6 hours after inoculation and
demonstrated no reduction in effect. Thus, the decisive period for
oxygen is considerably longer than that for antibiotics.
In 1964, two surgeons at Washington University in St. Louis,
Harvey Bernard and William Cole,21 reported on the first con-
trolled clinical trial of the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis and
demonstrated a benefit in abdominal operations. Thereafter,
numerous clinical trials were performed with somewhat vari-
able results. Eventually, these served to define the timing and
population in which prophylactic antibiotics work. By the 1970s,
antibiotic prophylaxis for high-risk surgery—meaning clean-
contaminated and contaminated cases—was becoming well
accepted and widely used, although some skeptics remained. In
1992, Classen et al.22 published their prospective series includ-
ing 2,847 patients undergoing clean or clean-contaminated surgi-
cal procedures at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, UT (Fig. 8-3).
They demonstrated that the decisive period for SSIs in humans

Incision
Figure 8-3 The figure demonstrates rates of surgical wound infec-
tion corresponding to the temporal relation between antibiotic admin-
istration and the start of surgery. The number of infections and the
number of patients for each hourly interval appear as the numerator
and denominator, respectively, of the fraction for that interval. The
trend toward higher rates of infection for each hour that antibiotic
administration was delayed after the surgical incision was significant
(z score = 2.00; p < .05 by the Wilcoxon test). (Adapted from Classen
DC, Evans RS, Pestotnik KS, et al. The timing of prophylactic adminis-
tration of antibiotics and the risk of surgical-wound infection. N Engl J
Med. 1992:326;281.)
undergoing surgery was essentially the same as for experimental
infections in guinea pigs. That is, they found the lowest infection
rate when antibiotics were given within 2 hours before or after
incision, and a rapid increase in SSI rate when they were given
outside that range. The best results, though only by a small mar-
gin and not statistically significant, were within 0 and 60 minutes
of surgery, and this subsequently became the clinical standard.
Antibiotic prophylaxis has now become standard for sur-
geries in which there is more than a minimum risk of infection
(^ N1CV 8-1). Although not every surgery and situation has
been studied, a strong rationale for the approach to prophylac-
tic antibiotics has emerged. Ideally, the antimicrobial of choice
for prophylaxis should prevent SSI, prevent SSI-related morbidity
and mortality, be cost-effective, avoid adverse effects, and have
no adverse consequences on the microbial flora of the patient or
of the hospital.23 The agent for antibiotic prophylaxis must cover
the most likely spectrum of bacteria presented in the surgical
field. The most common surgical-site pathogens in clean proce-
dures are skin flora, including Staphylococcus aureus and coag-
ulase-negative staphylococci (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis).
In clean-contaminated procedures, the most common pathogens
include gram-negative rods, and enterococci in addition to skin
flora. Data from the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance
(NNIS) system for 2006 to 2007 indicate that the proportion of
SSI caused by S. aureus has increased to 30%, with about half
caused by MRSA. Infections caused by MRSA are associated with
higher mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, and higher hos-
pital costs than infections caused by other agents. Nevertheless,
vancomycin is not recommended for routine agent for surgical
antimicrobial prophylaxis.23
Several groups separately developed guidelines for use of sur- A
gical prophylactic antibiotics, culminating in recommendations
published in 2004 by the National Surgical Infection Prevention
Project and updated in 2013.23 These guidelines emphasize timing
and choice of appropriate agents; a number of agents are recom-
mended as appropriate for each procedure, allowing for choices to
be guided by local sensitivity patterns and providing for alternate
agents in the case of drug sensitivity or allergy. (See Table 8-5 for
general recommendations.) The most commonly used antibiotic
for surgical prophylaxis is cefazolin, a first-generation cephalo-
sporin. It has proven efficacy, safety, and desirable duration of
action, and its spectrum of activity covers the organisms com-
monly encountered in SSIs.23
By definition, prophylactic antibiotics are given pre- or intraop- 5
eratively. The exact timing for the administration of the antibiotic
depends on the pharmacology and half-life of the drug. It has been
suggested that administration of prophylactic antibiotics is ideally
within 30 minutes to 1 hour of incision.22,23 Drugs given by bolus
administration (e.g., cefazolin) achieve adequate tissue concentra-
tion rapidly, so giving these drugs within 0 to 30 minutes of inci-
sions appears equally efficacious. Giving the antibiotics too early
(so that the incision is more than 60 minutes after the dose) is a
recurrent issue at many hospitals, especially in cases that require
complex patient positioning. Giving the antibiotics closer to the
incision time prevents this problem. Providing timely prophylac-
tic antibiotics is relatively uncomplicated for antibiotics that can
be given as a bolus dose (e.g., cephalosporins) or as an infusion
over a few minutes (e.g., clindamycin) and thus provide tissue lev"
els within minutes. For drugs like vancomycin that require infu-
sion over an hour or more, coordination of administration is more
complex. In general, it is considered acceptable if the infusion >s
started within 120 minutes before incision. Vancomycin is usually
given in the context of known or suspected MRSA colonization,
giving a dose of cefazolin in addition within an hour of incision >s

• Antibiotic prophylaxis choice, dose, and timing should be determined by a hospital committee based on national guidelines,24 local
patterns of antibiotic sensitivity, and other considerations.
• Always confirm the antibiotic selection with surgeons at the time-out or earlier.
■ The surgeon may wish to delay antibiotics until after culture.
■ Antibiotics may not be indicated (e.g., low-risk, elective procedures such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy or breast biopsy where
implants will not be used).
■ Make sure to record the reason for not giving antibiotics on the record.
• P-Lactam allergies.
a Penicillin allergy is almost never a contraindication to cefazolin or other cephalosporin administration. A documented history of
anaphylaxis or other serious reaction (angioedema, hives, bronchospasm, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis)
is the exception. Determine the severity of a patient's p-lactam allergy prior to choosing an alternative antimicrobial.
n Lack of understanding of a true allergic reaction can lead to choosing an antimicrobial with reduced efficacy, increased cost, and
greater risk of side effects.24
o Ideally, an antibiotic infusion should be completed before incision, but CMS guidelines consider starting the infusion before incision
adequate. When possible, for drugs requiring slow (>30 min) infusion, the infusion should be initiated preoperatively.
o When a tourniquet is used, the dose should be completed at least 5 min before the tourniquet is inflated.
o Dosing schedules are more frequent than for therapeutic use to maintain wound tissue levels throughout surgery and ongoing
contamination. Renal insufficiency may delay redosing, although initial dose is usually not affected.
° Additional intraoperative doses should be given when there is significant blood loss (~ half to one blood volume). Use the
recommended second dose for this purpose.
» When therapeutic antibiotics are given preoperatively for an infection or presumed infection (e.g., acute appendicitis), prophylactic
antibiotics are not required. Each situation should be examined individually: In some cases, coverage of skin flora may be appropriate
prior to skin incision, but often continuation of the therapeutic antibiotics is all that is required.

while providing coverage for MRSA with the vancomycin. When
a tourniquet is used, the infusion must be complete prior to infla-
tion of the tourniquet. An appropriate dose based on body weight
and volume of distribution should be given. Depending on the
half-life, antibiotics should be repeated during long operations or
operations with large blood loss.23 For example, cefazolin is nor-
mally dosed every 8 hours but the dose should be repeated every
4 hours intraoperatively.23 Finally, prophylactic antibiotics should
be discontinued by 24 hours following surgery if postoperative
dosing is selected at all. Prolonging the course of prophylactic
antibiotics does not reduce the risk of infection but does increase
the risk of adverse consequences of antibiotic administration,23
including resistance, C. difficile infection, and sensitization.
Because they have access to the patient during the 60 min-
utes prior to incision and can optimize timing of administration,
anesthesiologists should work in consultation with the surgeon
to use guidelines determined by the local infection control com-
mittee to take initiative for administering prophylactic antibiotics
NICV 8-2). In this way, anesthesiologists can make a major
contribution to preventing SSI. The Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services has identified timely and appropriate antibiotic
prophylaxis administration as a cornerstone of SSI prevention.
Physician and hospital reimbursements are increasingly tied to
such performance measures, meaning anesthesiologists also have
an economic interest in ensuring adherence to guidelines.
Mechanisms of Wound Repair
Wound healing is a complex process, requiring a coordinated
repair response including hemostasis, inflammation, matrix pro-
duction, neovascularization, epithelialization, and remodeling.
Many factors may impair wound healing. Systemic factors such
as medical comorbidities, nutrition,23 sympathetic nervous sys-
tem activation,26 and age25 have a substantial effect on the repair
process. Local environmental factors in and around the wound
including bacterial load, degree of inflammation, moisture con-
tent, oxygen tension, and vascular perfusion also have a profound
effect on healing.25,27,28 Although all of these factors are important,
perhaps the most critical element is oxygen supply to the wound.
Wound hypoxia impairs each of the components of healing.26
Although the role of oxygen is usually thought of in terms of
aerobic respiration and energy production via oxidative phos-
phorylation, in wound healing, oxygen is required as a cofactor for
enzymatic processes and for cell-signaling mechanisms. Oxygen is
a rate-limiting component in leukocyte-mediated bacterial killing
and collagen formation because specific enzymes require oxygen
at a partial pressure of at least 40 mmHg.29 The mechanisms by
which the other processes are oxygen dependent are less clear,
but these processes also require oxygen at a concentration much
above that required for cellular respiration.30,31
The /nff/a/ Response to Injury
A surgical incision disrupts the skin barrier, creating an acute
wound. An effective initial response to injury depends on hemo-
stasis and the ability to clean out foreign material and to resist
infection. This response initiates a sequence of events that starts
with any source of injury that disrupts homeostasis in the local
environment and eventually leads to healing.
Wound healing is described in four overlapping phases: hemo-
stasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.32 Each phase
is composed of complex interactions between host cells, con-
taminants, cytokines, and other chemical mediators that, when
functioning properly, lead to repair of injury. These processes are
highly conserved across species, indicating the critical importance
of the inflammatory response that directs the process of cellular
and tissue repair. When any component of healing is disturbed
and interrupts the orderly progression of repair, wound failure
may result.23,32
Injury damages the local circulation and causes plate-
lets to aggregate and release a variety of substances, including

chemoattractants and growth factors.32 The initial result is coagu-
lation, which prevents exsanguination but also widens the area
that is no longer perfused. Platelet degranulation releases platelet-
derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-0),
epidermal growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (1GF-1),
which joindy initiate the inflammatory process.32 Bradykinin,
complement, and histamine released by mast cells cause vasodila-
tion and increased vascular permeability. Polymorphonuclear leu-
kocytes arrive at the wound almost immediately and are followed
by macrophages within 24 to 48 hours. These inflammatory cells
activate in response to endothelial integrins, selectins, cell adhe-
sion molecules, cadherins, fibrin, lactate, hypoxia, foreign bodies,
infectious agents, and growth factors.32 In turn, macrophages and
lymphocytes produce more lactate33 and growth factors, includ-
ing IGF-l, leukocyte growth factor, interleukins (ILs) 1 and 2,
TGF-P, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).32 This
early inflammatory phase is characterized by erythema and edema
of the wound edges.
Activated neutrophils and macrophages also release proteases,
including neutrophil elastase, neutrophil collagenase, matrix
metalloproteinase, and macrophage metalloelastase.32 These pro-
teases degrade damaged extracellular matrix components to allow
their replacement. Proteases also degrade the basement mem-
brane of capillaries to enable inflammatory cells to migrate into
the wound.
In wounds, local blood supply is compromised at the same
time that metabolic demand is increased. As a result, the wound
environment becomes hypoxic and acidotic with high lactate
levels.34 This represents the sum of three effects: (1) decreased
oxygen supply due to vascular damage and coagulation; (2)
increased metabolic demand due to the heightened cellular
response (anaerobic glycolysis); and (3) aerobic glycolysis by
inflammatory cells.35 Leukocytes contain few mitochondria and
therefore acquire energy from glucose, primarily by production of
lactate and even in the presence of adequate oxygen supply.35 In
activated neutrophils, the respiratory burst, in which oxygen and
glucose are converted to superoxide, hydrogen ion, and lactate,
accounts for up to 98% of oxygen consumption; in the setting
of injury, this activity increases by up to 50-fold over baseline.29
Local hypoxia is a normal and inevitable result of tissue injury
(KK Video 8-1).36 Hypoxia acts as a stimulus to repair,33 but also
leads to poor healing and increased susceptibility to infection.27
Numerous experimental models as well as human clinical experi-
ence have led to the conclusion that healing is delayed in hypoxic
wounds. The partial pressure of oxygen in dermal wounds is het-
erogeneous, ranging from 0 to 10 mmHg in the central (“dead
space”) portion of the wound, to 80 to 100 mmHg (near arte-
rial) adjacent to perfused arterioles and capillaries (Fig. 8-4). The
PO2 of a given area depends on diffusion of oxygen from perfused
capillaries, and thus wound PO2 depends on capillary density,
arterial PO2, and the metabolic activity of the cells, with some
contribution from shifts in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve
associated with wound pH and temperature.
Resistance to
After a disruption of the normal skin barrier, successful wound
healing requires the ability to clear foreign material and resist
infection. Neutrophils provide nonspecific immunity and prevent
infection. Leukocytes migrate in tissue toward the site of injury
via chemotaxis, defined as locomotion oriented along a chemi-
cal gradient.32 Chemical gradients can be produced both exog-
enously and endogenously. Exogenous gradients result from
bacterial products present in contaminated tissues. Endogenous
mediators include components of the complement system (C5a),
products of lipoxygenase pathway (leukotriene B4), and cyto-
kines (IL-1, 8), along with lactate.38,39 Together, these chemical
mediators help to organize and control leukocyte invasion, bacte-
rial killing, necrotic tissue removal, and the initiation of neovas-
cularization and matrix production. In the absence of infection,
neutrophils disappear by about 48 hours. Nonspecific phagocyto-
sis and intracellular killing are the major immune pathways acti-
vated in wounds.29
Neutrophils are the primary cells responsible for nonspecific
immunity, and their function depends on a high partial pressure
of oxygen.29 This is because reactive oxygen species are the major
component of the bactericidal defense against wound pathogens.29

(also known as the primary oxidase or nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase [NADPH]-linked oxygenase),
present in the phagocytic membrane, which uses oxygen as the
substrate to catalyze the formation of superoxide. Superoxide
itself is bactericidal, but more importandy, it initiates a series
of cascades that produce other oxidants within the phagosome
that increase bacterial-killing capacity (Fig. 8-5). For example, in
the presence of superoxide dismutase, superoxide is reduced to
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 combines with chloride and in
the presence of myeloperoxidase forms the bactericidal hypochlo-
rous acid, more commonly recognized as the active ingredient in
bleach.40 Since intraphagosomal oxidant production depends on
conversion of oxygen to superoxide, the process is exquisitely
sensitive to the partial pressure of oxygen in the tissue. The Km
(half-maximal velocity) for the phagosomal oxidase using oxygen
as a substrate is 40 to 80 mmHg.29 This means that resistance to
infection is critically impaired by wound hypoxia and becomes
more efficient as PO2 increases even to very high levels (500 to
1,000 mmHg).29 Such levels do not occur naturally in tissue, but
can be achieved by the administration of hyperbaric oxygen.41,42
This is one mechanism for the proposed benefit of hyperbaric
oxygen therapy as an adjunctive treatment for necrotizing infec-
tions and chronic refractory osteomyelitis.43
Oxidants produced by inflammatory cells have a dual role in
wound repair. Not only are they central to resistance to infection,
but they also play a major role in initiating and directing the heal-
ing process. Oxidants, and in particular hydrogen peroxide pro-
duced via the respiratory burst, increase neovascularization and
collagen deposition in vitro and in vivo.40
Prolifers tion
The proliferative phase normally begins approximately 4 days
after injury, concurrent with a waning of the inflammatory phase.
It consists of granulation tissue formation and epithelialization.
Granulation involves neovascularization and synthesis of colla-
gen and connective tissue proteins.
Neovascularization
New blood vessels must replace the injured microcirculation.
Neovascularization in wounds proceeds both by angiogenesis
and vasculogenesis. Angiogenesis is the phenomenon of new
vessel growth via budding from existing vessels. In the setting
of wounds, new vessels grow from mature vessels, usually intact
postcapillary venules in the undamaged tissue immediately adja-
cent to the site of injury. Normally, the oxygen tension in adjacent
tissue is sufficient to support this process. The new vessel growth
extends and enters into the damaged areas that are typically high
in lactate and have a low partial pressure of oxygen. Mature extra-
cellular matrix is required for ingrowth of mature vessels.44
In vasculogenesis, bone marrow-derived endothelial precursor
cells (EPCs) populate the tissue and differentiate and grow into
new vessel tubules. In wounds, these tubules appear in the dam-
aged area before any direct anastomosis with pre-existing vessels
are made. These tubules must connect with existing vasculature
to establish an intact blood supply in the wound. Angiogenesis
has long been held as the primary mechanism for new blood ves-
sel growth in granulation tissue. Recent research, however, has
demonstrated that as many as 15% to 20% of new blood vessels in
wounds are derived from hematopoietic stem cells.44,45
Angiogenesis and vasculogenesis both occur in response to
similar stimuli, consisting of some combination of redox stress,
hypoxia, and lactate. However, the specific mechanisms by which
they proceed appear to differ somewhat. Angiogenesis involves
the movement of endothelial cells in response to three waves
of growth factors. The first wave of growth factors comes with
the release by platelets of platelet-derived growth factor, TGF-P,
IGF-1, and others during the inflammatory phase. The second
wave comes from fibroblast growth factor released from normal
binding sites on connective tissue molecules. The third and domi-
nant wave comes from VEGF, delivered largely by macrophages
stimulated by fibrinopeptides, hypoxia, and lactate.32 Although it
is usually present, hypoxia is not required for granulation because
of constitutive (aerobic) lactate production by inflammatory cells
and fibroblasts. Too little lactate leads to inadequate granulation,
while levels in excess of about 15 mM—usually associated with
inflammation or infection—delay granulation.46 The capillary
endothelial response to angiogenic agents requires oxygen so that
angiogenesis progresses in proportion to blood perfusion and
arterial PO2.47
Vasculogenesis occurs in response to similar stressors as angio-
genesis. EPCs are mobilized from the bone marrow into the cir-
culation via a nitric oxide-mediated mechanism. Tissue hypoxia
induces release of VEGF-A, which activates bone marrow stromal
nitric oxide synthase. Increased bone marrow nitric oxide leads to
release of EPCs into the circulation. These circulating EPCs home
to the wound via tissue-hypoxia—induced upregulation of stromal
cell-derived factor la. Within the wound, EPCs undergo differ-
entiation and participate in the formation of new blood vessels.45
180
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
Collagen and Extracellular Matrix Deposition
New blood vessels grow into the matrix that is produced by
fibroblasts. Although fibroblasts replicate and migrate mainly in
response to growth factors and chemoattractants, production of
mature collagen requires oxygen.26 Lactate, hypoxia, and some
growth factors induce collagen mRNA synthesis and procollagen
production. Posttranslational modification by prolyl and lysyl
hydroxylases is required to allow collagen peptides to aggregate
into triple helices. Collagen can only be exported from the cell
when it is in this triple helical structure. The helical configura-
tion is also primarily responsible for tissue strength. The activity
of the hydroxylases is critically dependent on vitamin C and tis-
sue oxygen tension, with a Km for oxygen of about 25 mmHg.26
Wound strength, which results from collagen deposition, is there-
fore highly vulnerable to wound hypoxia.
Neovascularization and extracellular matrix (primarily colla-
gen) production are closely linked. Fibroblasts cannot produce
mature collagen in the absence of mature blood vessels that
deliver oxygen to the site. New blood vessels cannot mature with-
out a strong collagen matrix. Mice kept in a hypoxic environment
of 13% inspired oxygen develop some new blood vessels in a test
wound with the addition of exogenous VEGF or lactate, but these
vessels are immature with little surrounding matrix and demon-
strate frequent areas of hemorrhage.30
Epithelialization
Epithelialization is characterized by replication and migration of
epithelial cells across the skin edges in response to growth factors.
Cell migration may begin from any site that contains living kera-
tinocytes, including remnants of hair follicles, sebaceous glands,
islands of living epidermis, or the normal wound edge. In acute
wounds that are primarily closed, epithelialization is normally
completed in 1 to 3 days. In open wounds healing by second-
ary intention, epithelialization is the final phase of healing and
cannot progress until the wound bed is fully granulated. Like
immunity and granulation, epithelialization depends on growth
factors and oxygen. Silver48 and Medawar49 demonstrated in vivo
that the rate of epithelialization depends on local oxygen. Topical
oxygen applied in a manner that does not dry out epithelial cells
has been advocated as a method to increase the rate of epitheliali-
zation.50 Ngo et al.51 demonstrated oxygen-dependent differentia-
tion and cell growth in human keratinocyte culture. In contrast,
O’Toole et al.52 demonstrated that hypoxia increases epithelial
migration in vitro. This may be explained, at least in part, by the
dependence of epithelialization on the presence of a bed of healthy
granulation tissue, which is known to be oxygen dependent.
Maturation an©/ Remodeling
The final phase of wound repair is maturation, which involves
ongoing remodeling of the granulation tissue and increasing
wound tensile strength. As the matrix becomes denser with
thicker, stronger collagen fibrils, it becomes stiffer and less com-
pliant. Fibroblasts are capable of adapting to changing mechanical
stress and loading. Fibroblasts migrate throughout the matrix to
help mold the wound to new stresses. Matrix metalloproteinases
and other proteases help with fibroblast migration and contin-
ued matrix remodeling in response to mechanical stress. Some
fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts under the influence of
TGF-P, resulting in contractile cells. As the myofibroblasts con-
tract, the collagenous matrix cross-links in the shortened position.
This helps to strengthen the matrix and minimize scar size. Con-
traction is inhibited by the use of high doses of corticosteroids.25
Even steroids given several days after injury have this effect. In
those wounds where contraction is detrimental, this effect can be
used for benefit. Although there is little definitive evidence, one
dose of dexamethasone intraoperatively to prevent postoperative
nausea and vomiting does not appear to impair healing.
Net collagen synthesis continues for at least 6 weeks and up to
6 months after wounding. Over time, the initial collagen threads
are reabsorbed and deposited along stress lines, conferring greater
tensile strength. Collagen found in granulation tissue is biochemi-
cally different from collagen of uninjured skin, and a scar never
achieves the tensile strength of uninjured skin. Hydroxylation and
glycosylation of lysine residues in granulation tissue collagen lead
to thinner collagen fibers. At 1 week, a wound closed by primary
intention has only reached 3% of the tensile strength of normal
skin. By 3 weeks it is at 30%, and it only reaches its maximum
tensile strength of 80% after 3 to 6 months.
Some wounds heal to excess. Hypertrophic scar and keloid
are common forms of abnormal scar due to aberrant responses to
healing. Hypertrophic scarring may be thought of as “exuberant”
scarring within the boundaries of the wound. The inflammatory
process that allows wound healing remains excessively active,
resulting in stiff, rubbery, nonmobile scar tissue. Hypertrophic
scars are most commonly seen following bums and in incisions
over areas of tension. They are thought to correlate with the length
of time required to close the wound and opposing tension forces
present in the wound, although other factors are also believed
to play a role. Keloids are scars that outgrow the boundaries of
the initial scar and are most typically seen following skin inci-
sions. Keloid formation most likely has a genetic predisposition,
although exogenous inflammatory factors may also play a role.
Wound Perfusion and Oxygenation
Complications of wounds include failure to heal, infection, and
excessive scarring or contracture. Rapid repair has the least poten-
tial for infection and excess scarring. The perioperative physi-
cian’s goals, therefore, are to avoid contamination, ensure rapid
tissue synthesis, and optimize the immune response. All surgical
procedures lead to some degree of contamination that must be
controlled by local host defenses. The initial hours after contami-
nation represent a decisive period during which inadequate local
defenses may allow an infection to become established.
Normally, wounds on the extremities and trunk heal more
slowly than those on the face. The major difference in these
wounds is the degree of tissue perfusion and thus the wound
tissue oxygen tension. As a rule, repair proceeds most rapidly
and immunity is strongest when wound oxygen levels are high,
and this is only achieved by maintaining perfusion of injured
tissue.26 Ischemic or hypoxic tissue, on the other hand, is highly
susceptible to infection and heals poorly, if at all.42 Wound tis-
sue oxygenation is complex and depends on the interaction of
blood perfusion, arterial oxygen tension, hemoglobin dissociation
conditions, carrying capacity, mass transfer resistances, and local
oxygen consumption. Wound oxygen delivery depends on vas-
cular anatomy, the degree of vasoconstriction, and arterial PO2.
The standard teaching that oxygen delivery depends more
on hemoglobin-bound oxygen (oxygen content) than on arterial
PO2 may be true of working muscle, but it is not true of wound
healing. In muscle, intercapillary distances are small and oxygen
consumption is high. In contrast, intercapillary distances are
large and oxygen consumption is relatively low in subcutane-
ous tissue.31 In wounds, where the microvasculature is damaged,
diffusion distances are substantially increased. Peripheral vaso-
constriction further increases diffusion distance.36 The driving
force of diffusion is partial pressure. Hence, a high PO2 is needed
8 Inflammation, Wound Healing, and Infection
to force oxygen into injured and healing tissues, particularly in
subcutaneous tissue, fascia, tendon, and bone, the tissues most at
risk for poor healing.
Although oxygen consumption is relatively low in wounds, it
is.consumed by processes that require oxygen at a high concentra-
tion. Inflammatory cells use little oxygen for respiration, produc-
ing energy largely via the hexose monophosphate shunt.29 Most of
the oxygen consumed in wounds is used for oxidant production
(bacterial killing), with a significant contribution as well for col-
lagen synthesis, angiogenesis, and epithelialization. The rate con-
stants (Km) for oxygen for these components of repair fall within
the physiologic range of 25 to 100 mmHg.26,29
Because of the high rate constants for oxygen substrate for
the components of repair, the rate at which repair proceeds var-
ies according to tissue PO2 from 0 to at least 250 mmHg. In vitro
fibroblast replication is optimal at a PO2 of about 40 to 60 mmHg.
Neutrophils lose their ability to kill bacteria in vitro below a PO2
of about 40 mmHg.26 These in vitro observations are clinically
relevant. “Normal” subcutaneous PO2, measured in test wounds
in uninjured, euthermic, euvolemic volunteers breathing room
air, is 65 ± 7 mmHg.53 Thus, any reduction in wound PO2 may
impair immunity and repair. In surgical patients, the rate of
wound infections is inversely proportional27 and collagen depo-
sition is directly proportional26 to postoperative subcutaneous
wound tissue oxygen tension.
High oxygen tensions (>100 mmHg) can be reached in
wounds but only if perfusion is rapid and arterial PO2 is high.26
This is because subcutaneous tissue serves a reservoir func-
tion, so there is normally flow in excess of nutritional needs and
wound cells consume relatively little oxygen, about 0.7/100 mL
of blood flow at a normal perfusion rate.31 When arterial oxy-
gen tension (PaO2) is high, this small volume can be carried
by plasma alone. Contrary to popular belief, therefore, oxygen-
carrying capacity—that is, hemoglobin concentration—is not
particularly important to wound healing, provided that perfusion
is normal.54 Wound PO2 and collagen synthesis remain normal
in individuals who have hematocrit levels as low as 15% to 18%
provided they can appropriately increase cardiac output, and
vasoconstriction is prevented.54
Peripheral vasoconstriction, which results from central sym-
pathetic control of subcutaneous vascular tone, is probably the
most frequent and clinically the most important impediment to
wound oxygenation. Subcutaneous tissue is both a reservoir to
maintain central volume and a major site of thermoregulation.
There is little local regulation of blood flow, except by local
heating.26 Therefore, subcutaneous tissue is particularly vulnera-
ble to vasoconstriction. Sympathetically induced peripheral vaso-
constriction is stimulated by cold, pain, fear, and blood volume
deficit,26 and by various pharmacologic agents including nico-
tine,53 P-adrenergic antagonists, and oq-agonists, all commonly
present in the perioperative environment. Use of low doses of
vasopressor agents to correct anesthesia (vasodilation)-induced
hypotension, however, does not generally impair wound perfu-
sion or free-flap survival.55 Perioperative hypothermia is common
and results from anesthetic drugs, exposure to cold, and redistri-
bution of body heat from the core to the periphery.56 Blood loss
and increases in insensible losses increase fluid requirements in
the perioperative period, thereby leaving the patient vulnerable to
inadequate fluid replacement. Thus, vasomotor tone is, to a large
degree, under the perioperative physician’s control.
Prevention or correction of hypothermia57 and blood vol-
ume deficits58 have been shown to decrease wound infections
and increase collagen deposition in patients undergoing major
abdominal surgery. Preoperative systemic (forced air warmer)
or local (warming bandage) warming have also been shown to
decrease wound infections, even in clean, low-risk surgeries such
as breast surgery and inguinal hernia repair.59 Subcutaneous tissue
oxygen tension is significandy higher in patients with good pain
control than in those with poor pain control after arthroscopic
knee surgery.60 Stress also causes wound hypoxia and signifi-
candy impairs wound healing and resistance to infection.25 These
effects are clearly mediated, in large part, by changes in the partial
pressure of oxygen in the injured tissue.
A number of groups have evaluated whether increasing inspired
oxygen during surgery can reduce SSls by increasing wound oxy-
gen levels. A 2015 Cochrane systematic review of 28 randomized
controlled trials did not demonstrate a benefit of 60% to 90%
inspired oxygen during surgery (except in some models that sup-
ported a benefit for colorectal surgery), although heterogeneity
and bias limited conclusions.61 Given the above discussion, it is
notable that few of the studies explicidy controlled for wound per-
fusion or oxygenation. Greif et al.,62 in the only study in which
wound oxygen was measured, demonstrated in a randomized,
controlled, double-blind trial including 500 patients that in warm,
volume-replete patients with good pain control undergoing major
colon surgery, administration of 80% versus 30% oxygen intraop-
eratively and for the first 2 hours after surgery significantly reduced
the wound infection rate by 50%. Wound oxygen levels were
significantly higher (almost double) intraoperatively and in the
postanesthesia care unit (PACU) in the 80% oxygen group. Belda
et al.63 replicated these results (significant 40% reduction in SSI) in
a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial in 300 colon surgery
patients randomized to 80% versus 30% oxygen intraoperatively
and during the first 6 hours after surgery. Surgical and anesthetic
management were standardized and intended to support optimal
perfusion, although wound oxygen was not measured. Myles
et al.64 demonstrated a significant reduction in major postopera-
tive complications, as well as specifically wound infections, in
2,050 major surgery patients randomized to 80% oxygen in 20%
nitrogen versus 30% oxygen in 70% nitrous oxide intraoperatively.
On the other hand, Meyhoff et al.37 found no difference in SSI
rate (20.1% vs. 19.1%, p = NS) as a function of oxygen administra-
tion in 1,400 patients undergoing colon and gynecologic surgery.
A major difference in design from the studies that demonstrated
benefit was the use of a highly restricted volume replacement regi-
men. The stated aim was that patients were to gain no more than
1 kg by the second day after operation. Without data on wound
oxygen (which was not measured), it is difficult to determine the
reason for the difference in outcome compared to the Greif, Belda,
and Myles studies, but wound vasoconstriction and a resulting
lack of increase in wound oxygen tension is a strong possibility.
Although the preponderance of evidence indicates that use
of high-inspired oxygen intraoperatively and providing supple-
mental oxygen postoperatively in well-perfused, patients under-
going major abdominal surgery will reduce the risk of wound
infection, there remains controversy about the benefits of
high-inspired oxygen. One factor in the hesitation to adopt
high-inspired oxygen is concern about potential side effects or
toxicity of 80% oxygen. Two of the above studies examined this
question in detail and found no difference in pulmonary compli-
cations or atelectasis.37 65 A randomized controlled trial in patients
at low risk for SSI (n = 100) found no difference in postoperative
oxygen requirement in patients randomized to 30% oxygen intra-
operatively versus those randomized to more than 90%.66 The
2015 Cochrane analysis of studies of high perioperative inspired
oxygen61 found no significant effect on mortality, although the
authors point out that the sample size is not sufficient to rule out
the possibility of harm. Thus, high-inspired oxygen appears to be
a low-risk approach to enhancing host defenses and reducing SSI,
so long as the priority is maintaining peripheral perfusion.

Section 2
Basic Science and Fundamentals
Perfusion and oxygen also play a key role in the effective-
ness of antibiotic prophylaxis. Delivery of antibiotics depends
on perfusion. Parenteral antibiotics dosed so that high levels of
antibiotic are present in the blood at the time of wounding (i.e.,
surgical prophylactic antibiotics) reduce wound infections, but
do not eliminate them; other interventions beyond antisepsis and
prophylactic antibiotics are required.22 In about one-third of all
wound infections, the bacteria cultured from the wound are sensi-
tive to the prophylactic antibiotic given to the patient, even when
the antibiotics were given according to standard procedure.22 The
vulnerable third of patients appear to be the hypoxic and vasocon-
stricted group. When antibiotics are present in the wound at the
time of injury, they are trapped in the fibrin clot at the wound site
where they may have efficacy against contaminating organisms.
Antibiotics diffuse poorly into the fibrin clot, however, so that
later administration, whether more than 2 hours after injury or in
response to wound infection, will have little effect. On the other
hand, oxygen diffuses easily through the fibrin clots and is effec-
tive even 6 hours after contamination.19
Bactericidal antibodies currently in use employ oxygen to
kill organisms in much the same way as phagocytes. Kohanski67
has demonstrated that quinolones, P-lactams, and aminoglyco-
sides kill S. aureus and Escherichia coli by stimulating hydroxyl
radical production from oxygen, even though all have different
mechanisms for entering bacteria. Suffer and Lloyd68 observed a
logarithmic reduction in bacterial cell counts in 10 to 15 hours in
aerobic conditions compared with more than 60 hours to achieve
the same result in an anaerobic environment for four faculta-
tive anaerobic staphylococcal strains exposed to vancomycin in
air-equilibrated versus hypoxic conditions. Thus, maintaining
conditions that optimize wound oxygen will also optimize the
effectiveness of many commonly used antibiotics.
Patient Management
A recent meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials, quasiex-
perimental studies, and cohort studies69 demonstrated that the
use of “bundles” of evidence-based care in patients undergoing
colorectal surgery significantly reduced the risk of SSI. Unfortu-
nately, as the authors note, there is currently “no consensus as to
what comprises the optimal colorectal surgical care bundle.” Stan-
dardization of care is likely responsible for some of the benefit.
Further study is required to identify individual best practices. In
the meantime, the following are approaches that anesthesiologists
can take with the aim of improving wound healing and resistance
to infection in their patients.
Preoperative Preparation
Given knowledge of the physiology of wound healing, what are
the best strategies for an anesthesiologist to pursue to ensure opti-
mal healing? SSIs result from a multitude of factors that include
the health of the patient, the type of surgery, the number and type
of organisms contaminating the surgical site, and surgical tech-
nique. To the degree they are predictable, interventions can be
targeted to those patients most at risk (Table 8-6).
Modifiable or potentially modifiable risks include smoking,
malnutrition, obesity, diabetes and hyperglycemia, chronic kidney
disease, steroid use, anemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperten-
sion. When possible, these should be assessed and corrected prior
to surgery. The decision to delay surgery must take into account
both the urgency of the surgery and the severity of the risk.
Stress also predisposes to poor wound healing. Adverse psy-
chosocial circumstances at the time of surgery may put patients

at risk for poor wound healing. Kiecolt-Glaser et al.70 studied the
impact of hostile marital interactions on the healing of experi-
mental blister wounds. High-hostile couples produced more pro-
inflammatory cytokines and healed more slowly than low-hostile
couples. Using a tape-stripping model, Muizzuddin et al.'1 inves-
tigated the effect of marital dissolution on skin barrier recovery
and found that high stress was associated with slower recovery.
Bosch et al.72 studied the healing of a circular wound on the oral
hard palate in subjects who varied in depression and/or dyspho-
ria. High-dysphoric individuals had higher wound sizes from
day 2 onward and depressive symptoms predicted slower wound
healing. Collectively, these studies point to links between psycho-
social distress, dysregulation at the system level, and impaired
capacity for wound healing. It seems likely that stress-reduction
techniques will reduce wound complications, and well-designed
clinical trials are needed in this area.
intraoperative Management
Careful surgical technique is fundamental to optimal wound
healing (Table 8-7). Delicate handling of the tissue, adequate
hemostasis, and surgeon experience leads to healthier wounds.
Incisions should be planned with regard to blood supply, particu-
larly when operating near or in old incisions. Mechanical retrac-
tors should be released from time to time to allow perfusion to
the wound edges. Judicious antibiotic irrigation of contaminated
areas may be effective. Because dried wounds lose perfusion,
wounds should be kept moist, especially during long operations.
Not all wounds can be anatomically closed. Edema, obesity, the
possibility of unacceptable respiratory compromise, or the need
to debride grossly contaminated or necrotic soft tissues can all
interfere with closure of the wound.
As the operation proceeds, new wounds are made and con-
tamination continues. All anesthetic agents tend to cause
hypothermia—first, by causing vasodilation, which redistributes

heat from core to periphery in previously vasoconstricted patients,
and second, by increasing heat loss and decreasing heat produc-
tion.56 Vasoconstriction is uncommon intraoperatively, as the
threshold for thermoregulatory vasoconstriction is decreased, but
may be severe in the immediate postoperative period when anes-
thesia is discontinued and the thermoregulatory threshold returns
to normal in the face of core hypothermia. The onset of pain with
emergence from anesthesia adds to this vasoconstriction because
of the associated catecholamine release.60 Maintenance of a high
room temperature or active warming before, during, and after the
operation is significantly more effective than other methods of
warming such as application of warm blankets, circulating water
blankets placed on the operating table surface, and humidification
of the breathing circuit.73
Forced air warming was the first practical means of keeping
patients warm intraoperatively. More recently, a number of other
effective approaches have been introduced, including resistive
warming, negative pressure warming, and thin, adhesive circulat-
ing water pads that are applied directly to the skin.74
Volume [Management
Intravascular volume management during surgery has implica-
tions for tissue perfusion and, therefore, wound healing. Numer-
ous factors, including patient comorbidities, medications such
as diuretics, fever, preoperative volume state, surgical proce-
dure, blood and insensible losses, and surgical stress, all influ-
ence fluid requirements during surgery. It is widely agreed that
the goal of intraoperative fluid management is to ensure suffi-
cient intravascular volume to maintain perfusion and maximize
oxygen delivery to the tissues, while avoiding the ill effects of
hypervolemia, namely interstitial edema; what is difficult to
determine is how to achieve that goal. Patient monitoring, fluid
choice, and fluid administration strategy are topics of much
debate, with a poorly standardized and often contradictory lit-
erature. For a comprehensive review of fluid management, see
Chapter 16.
Estimating preoperative volume status can be challenging, as
there are many factors to consider. Preoperative fluid state may
be reduced by fasting, mechanical bowel preparation, or medi-
cation use. Pre-existing medical conditions such as systolic and
diastolic heart failure may cause hypervolemia and physiology
that is exquisitely sensitive to fluid overload. While hemodialy-
sis reliably induces hypovolemia, patients with end-stage renal
disease are also susceptible to fluid overload, and intraoperative
fluid replacement is complex. Patient history and physical exami-
nation, for more straightforward patients, and other tools such
as preoperative echocardiography, for complex patients, can give
the anesthesiologist an idea of presurgical patient’s general vol-
ume status.
There are known serious complications of both hyper- and
hypovolemia, particularly in the perioperative period. The major
complications of hypovolemia, aside from hemodynamic insta-
bility, include decreased oxygenation of surgical wounds (which
predisposes to wound infection),26,27,75 decreased collagen for-
mation,58 impaired wound healing, and increased wound break-
down. The major complications associated with hypervolemia
include pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, edema of gut
with prolonged ileus, and possibly an increase in cardiac arrhyth-
mias.76 Inappropriately high fluid administration may result in
elevated atrial natriuretic peptide, inducing endothelial glycoca-
lyx dysfunction, with resultant vascular permeability and extra-
vascular fluid shifts.81
Patients appear to benefit from ingestion of high-carbohydrate,
clear liquids 2 to 3 hours prior to surgery in order to achieve a
euvolemic state at the start of surgery.78 In addition to providing
hydration, there is evidence that this is a safe practice with the
additional benefits of increased patient satisfaction and decreased
postoperative insulin resistance.
Intraoperative assessment of fluid status is necessary for opti-
mization of intravascular volume. Estimates of blood loss, third-
space fluid losses, and maintenance requirements are notoriously
inaccurate and may lead to either over- or underreplacement if
used as guides. Surgical stress can result in increased intravenous
fluid requirements. The increased fluid requirement may be partly
due to substances like IL-6, TNF, substance-P, and bradykinin,
which are released in response to, and in proportion to, surgical
stress.79 These inflammatory mediators cause both vasodilation
and an increase in vascular permeability80 However, the concept
of third spacing as a cause of functional intravascular fluid deple-
tion has been challenged.81
Optimizing the volume of perioperative fluid administration 9
to minimize morbidity and mortality remains a significant and
controversial challenge. Currently, most practitioners rely on
clinical acumen, vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure,
and urine output to manage perioperative fluids. Surgical patients
can be markedly hypovolemic without a change in any one of
these variables because of the compensatory action of periph-
eral vasoconstriction.26 Unfortunately, this shunts blood away
from skin, increases wound hypoxemia, and increases the risk
of surgical wound infection. Static monitors such as heart rate,
blood pressure, urine output, central venous pressure,26,82 and
pulmonary artery catheters have been shown to be limited. More
dynamic monitors such as stroke volume assessment, pulse pres-
sure variation, and systolic pressure variation can be predictive of
fluid responsiveness83; however, these have limitations, including
the requirements of a regular R to R interval, closed chest, and
adequate tidal volumes. Echocardiography, including assessment
of stroke volume and other indices for preload, afterload, and con-
tractility, can be a helpful intraoperative guide,84 but large-scale
clinical trials are needed to validate its use as a dynamic modal-
ity for monitoring. Additional limitations include lack of avail-
able hardware and expertise, although newer technologies and
increasing focus on training in perioperative point-of-care ultra-
sound are beginning to address these.
Intraoperative fluid optimization strategies have ranged from
liberal, to restrictive (also known as zero balance), to goal directed
(SV optimization). There is evidence that increased volume may
be beneficial for skin perfusion. Arkilic et al.75 randomized 56
patients to liberal (16 to 18 mL/kg/h) or conservative (8 mL/kg/h)
intraoperative fluid therapy and measured tissue perfusion and
oxygen tension as a surrogate for wound healing. The liberal fluid
regimen was associated with significandy greater intraoperative
subcutaneous oxygen tension as measured by a tissue oxygen
sensor. The study was too small to evaluate the effect on wound
complications. Kabon et al.83 performed a randomized, con-
trolled trial to compare standard- (8 mL/kg/h) versus high (16 to
18 mL/kg/h)-volume administration in 253 patients undergoing
elective colon resection. The group that received high volume had
a rate of 8.5% SSI; the rate was 11.3% in the group with standard
volume which would be a clinically significant reduction, if real
Unfortunately, the study was terminated early, so it had inade-
quate power to detect a difference of that size. Patients at high risk
for heart failure or with end-stage renal disease were excluded,
so the study also has limited generalizability. On the other side,
there is concern that liberal fluid administration may be exces-
sive and may be detrimental to patients. In a systematic review,
Holte et al.81 found benefit in avoiding excessive fluid administra-
tion in major surgery.
The discussion of “liberal” and “restricted” fluids requires
consideration of whether colloids or crystalloids are preferable for
184
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
intraoperative fluid administration. Synthetic colloids have been
associated with coagulopathy when large volumes are delivered,
which appears to be in large part mediated by dilution of coagula-
tion factors.86 The intravascular half-life of colloids, either albu-
min or synthetic colloids, is much longer than that of crystalloids,
allowing the total volume of fluid administered to be reduced by
including colloids in surgical fluid resuscitation.86 Edema forma-
tion may also be decreased. A number of studies76'86"89 purport
to evaluate intraoperative or postoperative fluid administration in
terms of restrictive versus traditional fluid management. Virtu-
ally all have compared colloid (“restrictive” group) with crystal-
loid (“traditional” group) administration. Thus, the “restricted”
volume group likely received a larger amount of effective intravas-
cular volume than the traditional or “liberal” group. In general,
these studies have demonstrated improved outcomes (reduction
in SSI, earlier return of bowel function) for the colloid group. The
mechanism for the benefit is unclear, however, as on the basis
of effective intravascular volume delivered, the crystalloid groups
might actually have been less well volume replaced than the col-
loid groups.
What is clear is that fluid overload to the point of intersti-
tial edema is not beneficial for most organ function, including
kidneys, liver, lungs, and heart. Interstitial edema can result in
poor wound healing and infection due to decreased oxygen dif-
fusion distance. Finding the balance between appropriate vol-
ume supplementation for adequate perfusion and avoiding tissue
edema is the challenge. One of the difficulties in interpreting
the literature on volume management is the lack of standardiza-
tion of definitions such as “liberal” and “restricted,” the amount
and combinations of fluid used for replacement, and the lack of
standardization of targets and outcomes. At this time, an indi-
vidualized plan based on preoperative and intraoperative volume
assessment, and appropriate monitoring, depending on the com-
plexity of comorbidities and the surgical procedure, is required
to attempt to find this balance for every patient. Goal-directed
therapy, using stroke volume variation or echocardiography, holds
promise, but much work remains to be done to define and imple-
ment reliable standards.
Current best recommendations include replacing fluid losses
based on standard recommendations (Table 8-8) for the type
of surgery, replacement of blood loss, and replacement of other
ongoing fluid losses (e.g., high urine output due to diuretic or
dye administration, hyperglycemia, or thermoregulatory vasocon-
striction). Maintenance of normothermia is also critical to opti-
mal volume management. Warm patients are unlikely to develop
pulmonary edema with a high rate of fluid administration because
they have excess capacitance due to vasodilation. Cold patients,
on the other hand, are highly susceptible to pulmonary edema
even after relatively small fluid boluses. Thermoregulatory vaso-
constriction increases afterload, causing increased cardiac work.
Moreover, administered fluid cannot open up constricted vessels
until the hypothermic stimulus is removed; thus, there is virtually
no excess capacitance in the system.
Pain control should be addressed intraoperatively so that
patients do not have severe pain on emergence. Achieving the goal
is more important than the technique used to do so. Although
regional anesthesia and analgesia may provide superior pain relief,
the effects of specific analgesic regimens on wound outcome have
not yet adequately been studied.
Postoperative Management
Wounds are most vulnerable in the first few hours after surgery
(Table 8-9). Although antibiotics lose their effectiveness after
the first hours, oxygen-mediated natural wound immunity lasts

longer.19 Even a short period of vasoconstriction during the first
day is sufficient to reduce oxygen supply and increase infec-
tion risk.27 Correction and prevention of vasoconstriction in the
first 24 to 48 hours after surgery will have significant beneficial
effects.27 Given the large number of diabetic patients who undergo
surgery, along with the fact that the stress response frequendy
induces hyperglycemia intraoperatively even in nondiabetic
patients, guidelines for controlling blood sugar in perioperative
patients are critical to prevention of SSI. Unfortunately, balancing
a narrow therapeutic window between hypoglycemia and hyper-
glycemia is a complex issue in blood sugar control. Clinical trials
have provided conflicting results. A 2001 randomized controlled
trial demonstrated a 25% reduction in risk of septicemia in criti-
cally ill surgical patients whose blood glucose levels were more
tightly controlled than a comparison group.90 On the other hand,

Keep patient warm.
Provide analgesia to keep patient comfortable, if not pain free.
Patient report and the ability to move freely are the best signs
of adequate pain relief.
Only one more dose of antibiotic unless an infection is present
or contamination continues.
Keep up with third-space losses. Remember that fever increases
fluid losses.
Assess perfusion and react to abnormalities.
Avoid diuresis until pain is gone and patient is warm.
Assess losses (including thermal losses) if wound is open.
Assess need for parenteral or enteral nutrition and respond.
Continue to control hypertension and hyperglycemia.
8 Inflammation, Wound Healing, and Infection
in 2007, Gandhi et al.91 found no difference in SSI in 400 cardiac
surgery patients comparing a target blood sugar of 80 to 100 ver-
sus less than 200 mg/dL. The NICE-SUGAR study in 6,104 ICU
patients demonstrated excess mortality in the tight control (81 to
108 mg/dL) versus standard (<180 mg/dL) group.92 The current
recommendation is to keep glucose close to normal (e.g., 100 to
180 or 200 mg/dL).93
All vasoconstrictive stimuli must be corrected simultane-
ously to allow optimal healing. Volume is the last to be corrected
because vasoconstriction for other reasons induces diuresis and
renders the patient relatively hypovolemic (peripherally, not cen-
trally). These measures are particularly important in any patients
at high risk for wound complications for other reasons (e.g., mal-
nutrition, steroid use, diabetes), or when vasoconstrictive drugs
such as p-blockers and a-agonists are required for other reasons.
Local perfusion is not assured until patients have a normal
blood volume, are warm and pain free, and are receiving no
vasoconstrictive drugs; that is, until the sympathetic nervous
system is inactivated. Warming should continue until patients
are thoroughly awake and active and can maintain their own
thermal balance. After major operations, warming may be use-
ful for many hours or even days. The goal is to achieve warmth
at the skin; wound vasoconstriction due to cold surroundings
often coexists with core hyperthermia. Moderate hyperthermia
is not, itself, a problem. When extensive wounds are left open,
warmth should be continued, and heat losses due to evaporation
should be prevented to avoid vasoconstriction and to minimize
caloric losses.
Assessing perfusion, especially in the PACU, is critical. Unfor-
tunately, urine output is a poor, often misleading guide to periph-
eral perfusion. Markedly low output may indicate decreased renal
perfusion, but normal or even high urine output has litde correla-
tion to wound or tissue PO2. Many factors commonly present in
the perioperative period, including hyperglycemia, dye adminis-
tration, thermoregulatory vasoconstriction, adrenal insufficiency,
and various drugs, may cause inappropriate diuresis in the face of
mild hypovolemia.
Physical examination of the patient is a better guide to hypo-
volemia and vasoconstriction. Assess vasoconstriction by a capil-
lary return time of more than 2 to 3 seconds at the forehead and
more than 5 seconds over the patella. Eye turgor is another good
measure of volume status. Finally, patients can usually distinguish
thirst from a dry mouth. Skin should be warm and dry.
After major abdominal surgery, third-space losses continue for
about 12 to 24 hours, so increased fluid requirements continue.
In general, for large abdominal cases, 2 to 3 mL/kg/h of IV fluids
is sufficient for the first 12 to 24 postoperative hours. After that
period, the IV rate should be decreased below calculated main-
tenance levels because edema fluid begins to be mobilized, thus
increasing circulating intravascular volume.
When excessive tissue fluids have accumulated, diuresis
should be undertaken gently so that transcapillary refill can
maintain blood volume. This applies to patients who need renal
dialysis as well. The average dialysis patient vasoconstricts suf-
ficiently to lower tissue PO2 by 30% or more during dialysis; it
takes about 24 hours for vasomotor tone and wound and tissue
PO2 to return normal.94 Fluid losses from the vascular system are
not necessarily replaced from the tissues as rapidly as they are
sustained. Tissue edema may be the price paid for adequate intra-
vascular volume. Edema increases intracapillary distance, so that
there may be a delicate balance between excessive edema and
peripheral vasoconstriction (which worsens the hypoxia caused
by edema).
Vasoconstrictive drugs should be avoided. The most common
and most avoidable is nicotine in the form of cigarettes. High-dose
a-adrenergic agonists or other vasopressors may cause harm by
decreasing tissue PO2, but lower doses have little or no effect on
wound/tissue PO2.35 It is important to remember that decreasing
cardiac output may also reduce wound perfusion. Thus, a balance
must be maintained between minimizing use of vasopressors and
maintaining adequate cardiac output.
Maintenance of tissue PO2 requires attention to pulmonary 10
function postoperatively. Administration of supplemental oxygen
via face mask or nasal cannula increases safety in patients receiv-
ing systemic opioids.95 Pain control also appears important since it
favorably influences both pulmonary function and vascular tone.
This is particularly true in patients at high risk for pulmonary
complications postoperatively, such as morbidly obese patients
and those with pulmonary disease.
Summary
In patients with moderate to high risk of SSI, anesthesiologists 11
have the opportunity to enhance wound healing and reduce the
incidence of wound infections by simple, inexpensive, and readily
available means. Intraoperatively, appropriate antibiotic use, hand
hygiene and attention to reducing workspace contamination, and
prevention of vasoconstriction through appropriate volume admin-
istration and active warming clearly have benefit. In patients at
high risk of SSI, maintenance of a high PaO2 (300 to 500 mmHg)
may also have benefit—and there is no evidence of harm from
brief exposures of several hours. Postoperatively, the focus should
remain on prevention of vasoconstriction through pain relief,
warming, and adequate volume administration in the PACU. The
addition of measures to reduce and prevent the stress response is
likely to be effective as well, although further study is required.

Summary
1	Anesthesiologists routinely administer multiple parenteral agents in the perioperative period, including drugs
(antibiotics, anesthetic agents, neuromuscular blocking agents [NMBAs]), polypeptides (i.e., protamine), and
blood products, or patients are exposed to environmental antigens (i.e., latex) all of which can produce an allergic
reaction.
2	Cytokines are inflammatory cell activators synthesized to act as secondary messengers and activate endothelial and
white cells.
3	Antibodies are specific proteins called immunoglobulins that can recognize and bind to specific antigens, and
usually, IgE or IgG is implicated in allergic reactions.
4	Immune competence during surgery can be affected by direct and hormonal effects of anesthetic drugs,
immunologic effects of other drugs used, type of surgery, coincident infection, and transfused blood
products.
5	Most of the allergic reactions evoked by intravenous drugs occur within 5 minutes of administration. In the
anesthetized patient, the most common life-threatening manifestation of an allergic reaction is circulatory collapse,
reflecting vasodilation, and decreasing venous return.
6	Some drugs administered perioperatively, such as vancomycin, can release histamine in a dose-dependent,
nonimmunologic fashion.
7	A plan for treating anaphylactic reactions should be considered by clinicians that includes airway maintenance,
100% oxygen administration, intravascular volume expansion, and epinephrine, which are essential to
treat the hypotension and hypoxia resulting from vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and
bronchospasm. Norepinephrine, vasopressin, and additional diagnostic monitoring should be considered for
refractory shock.
8	After an anaphylactic reaction, it is important to attempt to identify the causative agent to prevent
readministration.
9	Health care workers, children following multiple procedures, and individuals with specific food allergies have been
recognized to be at increased risk for latex anaphylaxis. However, latex has been removed as an environmental
antigen over the years.
10	NMBAs have several unique molecular features that make them potential antigens that can cause anaphylaxis.
Introduction
1	Allergic reactions represent an important cause of perioperative
complications. Anesthesiologists routinely administer multiple
drugs and blood products and manage patients during their peri-
operative medical care, where they are exposed to multiple agents,
including drugs (i.e., antibiotics, anesthetic agents, neuromuscu-
lar blocking agents [NMBAs]), polypeptides (protamine), blood
products, and environmental antigens (i.e., latex). Anesthesiolo-
gists must be able to rapidly recognize and treat anaphylaxis, the
most life-threatening form of an allergic reaction.1
The allergic response represents just one aspect of the
pathologic response that the immune system evolved to rec-
ognize foreign substances. As part of normal host surveillance
mechanisms, a series of cellular and humoral elements oversees
foreign surfaces of cell surfaces and molecular structures called
antigens to provide host defense. These foreign substances (anti-
gens) consist of molecular arrangements found on cells, bacteria,
viruses, proteins, or complex macromolecules.2,3 Immunologic
mechanisms (1) involve antigen interaction with antibod-
ies or specific effector cells; (2) are reproducible; and (3) are
specific and adaptive, distinguishing foreign substances and
amplifying reactivity through a series of inflammatory cells and
proteins. The immune system serves to protect the body against
external microorganisms and toxins, as well as internal threats
from neoplastic cells; however, it can respond inappropriately to
cause hypersensitive (allergic) reactions. Life-threatening aller-
gic reactions to drugs and other foreign substances observed

perioperatively may represent different expressions of the
immune response.2,3
Bask Immunologic Principles
The immune system protects the body from invasion by organ-
isms by recognizing and removing foreign substances called
antigens that are molecular structures, usually proteins and/or
carbohydrates. The body also has mechanisms to tolerate simi-
lar molecular configurations of the host (self-tolerance); how-
ever, problems arise when the immune system is dysfunctional,
as in cases of autoimmunity that can give rise to serious diseases,
including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The immune response
includes both cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity.
Cell-mediated immunity involves immune cells directed at the
elimination or destruction of pathogens or cells. Humoral immu-
nity comprises antibodies and proteins (e.g., complement, cyto-
kines, and signaling molecules) that can direcdy or in concert
with cellular immunity orchestrate cell injury and destruction.
The purpose is to provide host defense mechanisms.
2	As part of humoral immune responses, protein mediators called
cytokines and chemokines are released initially by inflammatory
responses to bring other immune cells to the site of the injury or
infection, cause additional inflammatory responses and fever, and
increase capillary permeability to allow other immune cells to migrate
and translocate to the site of injury This inflammatory response also
causes hemostatic activation and produces pain, erythema, and
edema locally and potentially systemically, depending on the extent
of the injury. Cytokines have an extensive spectrum of inflammatory
effects and have been extensively studied following acute infections.4
The immune response can be variable in onset from immediate in
anaphylaxis to days for cellular responses, and can remember anti-
gens for many years, especially following immunization.
Although this is a simplified review of the immune system, it is
important to consider individual aspects of the immune response
and their importance.
^AnS/gens
As mentioned, molecules stimulating an immune response (anti-
body production or lymphocyte stimulation) are called antigens.5,6
Only a few drugs used by anesthesiologists, such as polypeptides
(protamine) and other large macromolecules (dextrans), are com-
plete antigens (Table 9-1). Most commonly used drugs are simple
organic compounds of low molecular weight (around 1,000 Da).
For most drugs that are small molecules, to become immuno-
genic, they must bind two circulating proteins or tissues to result
in an antigen (hapten-macromolecular complex). Small molec-
ular weight substances such as drugs or drug metabolites that
bind to host proteins or cell membranes to sensitize patients are

Penicillin and its derivatives	Aprotinin Blood Products
Anesthetic drugs	Chymopapain Colloid Volume Expanders Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Protamine Latex
called haptens. Haptens are not antigenic by themselves. Often,
a reactive drug metabolite (i.e., penicilloyl derivative of penicil-
lin) is believed to bind with macromolecules to become antigens.
Certain molecular structures in bacteria or fungi are immedi-
ately recognized as foreign by multiple aspects of the immune
system.
Thymus-Der/ved (T-cell) and
Bursa-Derived (B-cell) Lymphocytes
The thymus of the fetus differentiates immature lymphocytes into
thymus-derived cells (T cells). T cells have receptors that are acti-
vated by binding with foreign antigens and secrete mediators that
regulate the immune response. The subpopulations of T cells in
humans include helper, suppressor, cytotoxic, and killer cells.5,6
The two types of regulatory T cells are helper cells (OKT4) and
suppressor cells (OKT8). Helper cells are important for key effec-
tor cell responses, whereas suppressor cells inhibit immune func-
tion. Infection of helper T cells with a retrovirus, the human
immunodeficiency virus, produces a specific increase in the num-
ber of suppressor cells. Cytotoxic T cells destroy mycobacteria,
fungi, and viruses. Other lymphocytes, called natural killer cells,
do not need specific antigen stimulation to set up their role. Both
the cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells take part in defense
against tumor cells and in transplant rejection. T cells produce
mediators that influence the response of other cell types involved
in the recognition and destruction of foreign substances?-6
B cells represent a specific lymphocyte cell line that can dif-
ferentiate into specific plasma cells that synthesize antibodies, a
step controlled by both helper and suppressor T-cell lymphocytes.
B cells are also called bursa-derived cells because, in birds, the
bursa of Fabricius is important in producing cells responsible for
antibody synthesis.
Antibodies
Antibodies are specific proteins called immunoglobulins that can 3
recognize and bind to a specific antigen. The basic structure of
the antibody molecule is illustrated in Figure 9-1. Each antibody

two Fab fragments and one Fc fragment. Antigen binding occurs on the
Fab fragments, whereas the Fc segment is responsible for membrane
binding or complement activation. (Reprinted from Levy JH. Anaphy-

has at least two heavy chains and two light chains that are bound
together by disulfide bonds. The Fab fragment has the ability to
bind antigen, and the Fc, or crystallizable, fragment is respon-
sible for the unique biologic properties of the different classes
of immunoglobulins (cell binding and complement activation).
Antibodies function as specific receptor molecules for immune
cells and proteins. When antigen binds covalendy to the Fab
fragments, the antibody undergoes conformational changes to
activate the Fc receptor. The results of antigen-antibody binding
depend on the cell type, which causes a specific type of activation
(i.e., lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation into antibody-
secreting cells, mast cell degranulation, and complement activa-
tion). Multiple therapeutic agents are based on Fab fragments that
bind irreversibly to a specific molecular configuration or drug and
include such agents as abciximab (a platelet inhibitor that binds
the Ilb/lIIa receptor) and idarucizumab (that binds to dabigatran
to reverse its anticoagulant effect).
Five major classes of antibodies occur in humans: IgG, IgA,
IgM, IgD, and IgE. The heavy chain determines the structure and
function of each molecule. The basic properties of each antibody
are listed in Table 9-2.
Effector Cells and Proteins of the
Immune Response
Cells
Monocytes, neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]),
and eosinophils represent important effector cells that migrate
into areas of inflammation in response to specific chemotactic
factors, including lymphokines, cytokines, and complement-
derived mediators. The deposition of antibody or complement
fragments on the surface of foreign cells is called opsoniza-
tion, a process that promotes killing foreign cells by effector
cells. In addition, lymphokines and cytokines produce chemo-
taxis of other inflammatory cells as described in the following
sections.5,6 Activation of this cellular process is orchestrated by
multiple mechanisms as part of host defense systems that func-
tion to contain and remove invading organisms during acute
infections.4,7
As part of this complex acute inflammatory response, host injury
occurs, as we have seen during the pandemic due to CO VID-19.4,7
Monocytes and Macrophages
Macrophages regulate immune responses by processing and pre-
senting antigens to affect inflammatory, tumoricidal, and micro-
bicidal functions. Macrophages arise from circulating monocytes
or may be confined to specific organs such as the lung. They are
recruited and activated in response to microorganisms or tissue
injury. Macrophages ingest antigens before they interact with
receptors on the lymphocyte surface to regulate their action. Mac-
rophages synthesize mediators to facilitate both B-lymphocyte
and T-lymphocyte responses.
Polymorphonuclear Leukocytes (Neutrophils)
The first cells to appear in an acute inflammatory reaction are
neutrophils that contain acid hydrolases, neutral proteases, and
lysosomes. Once activated, they produce hydroxyl radicals, super-
oxide, and hydrogen peroxide, which aid in microbial killing.
Eosinophils
The exact function of the eosinophil in host defense is unclear;
however, inflammatory cells recruit eosinophils to collect at sites
of parasitic infections, tumors, and allergic reactions.
Basophils
Basophils comprise 0.5% to 1% of circulating granulocytes in the
blood. On the surface of basophils are IgE receptors, which func-
tion similarly to those on mast cells.
Mast Cells
Mast cells are important cells for immediate hypersensitivity
responses. They are tissue fixed and located in the perivascular
spaces of the skin, lung, and intestine. On the surface of mast cells
are IgE receptors, which bind to specific antigens. Once activated,
these cells release physiologically active mediators important to
immediate hypersensitivity responses (see IgE-Mediated Patho-
physiology section under Anaphylactic Reactions). Mast cells can
be activated by a series of both immune and nonimmune stimuli.
9 The Allergic Response
Proteins
Cytokines/lnterleukins
Cytokines are inflammatory cell activators synthesized by mac-
rophages to act as secondary messengers and activate endothe-
lial cells and white cells.8 Interleukins, tumor necrosis factor,
and interferon are examples of cytokines considered important
mediators of the biologic responses to infection and other inflam-
matory reactions. Liberation of interleukin-1 and tumor necro-
sis factor produces fever, neuropeptide release, endothelial cell
activation, increased adhesion molecule expression, neutrophil
priming, hypotension, myocardial suppression, and a catabolic
state.8 The term interleukin was coined for a group of cytokines
that promotes communication between and among (“inter”)
leukocytes (“leukin”). Interleukins are a group of different reg-
ulatory proteins that control many aspects of the immune and
inflammatory responses. The interleukins are polypeptides syn-
thesized in response to cellular activation; they produce their
inflammatory’ effects by activating specific receptors on inflam-
matory cells and vasculature. T-cell lymphocytes influence the
activity of other immunologic and nonimmunologic cells by
producing an array of interleukins that they secrete. Different
interleukins of this class have been isolated and characterized;
they function as short-range or intracellular soluble mediators of
the immune and inflammatory responses. The interleukin fam-
ily of cytokines has been rapidly growing in number because of
advances in gene cloning.
Complement
The primary humoral response to antigen and antibody bind-
ing is the activation of the complement system.9,10 The comple-
ment system consists of around 20 different proteins that bind
to activated antibodies, other complement proteins, and cell
membranes. The complement system is an important effector
system of inflammation. Complement activation can be initi-
ated by IgG or IgM binding to antigen, by plasmin through
the classic pathway, by endotoxin, or by drugs through the
alternate (properdin) pathway (Fig. 9-2). Specific fragments
released during complement activation include C3a, C4a, and
C5a, which have important humoral and chemotactic prop-
erties (see Non-IgE-Mediated Reactions section). The major
function of the complement system is to recognize bacteria
both directly and indirectly by attracting phagocytes (che-
motaxis), as well as the increased adhesion of phagocytes to
antigens (opsonization), and cell lysis by activation of the
complete cascade.9,10
A series of inhibitors regulates activation to ensure regulation
of the complement system. Hereditary (autosomal dominant) or
acquired (associated with lymphoma, lymphosarcoma, chronic
lymphatic leukemia, and macroglobulinemia) angioedema is an
example of a deficiency in an inhibitor of the Cl complement
system (Cl esterase deficiency). This syndrome is characterized
by recurrent increased vascular permeability of specific subcuta-
neous and serosal tissues (angioedema), which produces laryn-
geal obstruction and respiratory and cardiovascular abnormalities
after tissue trauma and surgery, or without any obvious precipitat-
ing factor.11 One of the important pathologic manifestations of
complement activation is acute pulmonary vasoconstriction asso-
ciated with protamine administration.1
Effects ©f/InestAsesfa ©srn
ilmiime Function
Anesthesia and surgery depress nonspecific host resistance mech- 4
anisms, including lymphocyte activation and phagocytosis.12
Immune competence during surgery can be affected by direct and
hormonal effects of anesthetic drugs, immunologic effects of other
drugs used, specific surgery, coincident infections, and transfused
blood products. Blood represents a complex of humoral and cel-
lular elements that may alter immunomodulation to various anti-
gens. Although multiple studies demonstrate in vitro changes in
immune function, no studies have ever proved their importance.12
Besides, such changes are likely of minor importance compared
with the hormonal aspects of stress responses.
Hypersensitivity Responses
(Allergy)
Gell and Coombs first described a scheme for classifying immune
responses to understand specific diseases mediated by immuno-
logic processes. The immune pathway functions as a protective
mechanism, but can also react inappropriately to produce hyper-
sensitivity or allergic response. They defined four basic types of
hypersensitivity, types I to IV It is useful first to review all four
mechanisms to understand the different immune reactions that
occur in humans.
Type / Reactions
Type 1 reactions are anaphylactic or immediate-type hypersen-
sitivity reactions (Fig. 9-3). Physiologically active mediators are
released from mast cells and basophils after antigen binding to IgE

can be activated by either the classic pathway (IgG, IgM-antigen inter-
action) or the alternate pathway (endotoxin, drug interaction). Small
peptide fragments of C3 and C5 called anaphylatoxins (C3a, C5a) that
are released during activation are potent vasoactive mediators. For-
mation of the complete complement cascade produces a membrane
attack unit that lyses cell walls and membranes. An inhibitor of the
complement cascade, the C1 esterase inhibitor, ensures the comple-
ment system is turned off most of the time.
Figure 9-3 Type I immediate hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis)
involve IgE antibodies binding to mast cells or basophils by way of
their Fc receptors. On encountering immunospecific antigens, the IgE
becomes cross-linked, inducing degranulation, intracellular activation,
and release of mediators. This reaction is independent of complement.

injury.
US Reactions
Type II reactions are also known as antibody-dependent cell-medi-
ated cytotoxic hypersensitivity or cytotoxic reactions (antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic) (^ NICV 9-1, Fig. 9-4). These
reactions are mediated by either IgG or IgM antibodies directed
against antigens on the surface of foreign cells. These antigens
may be either integral cell membrane components (A or B blood
group antigens in ABO incompatibility reactions) or haptens
that absorb to the surface of a cell, stimulating the production of
antihapten antibodies (autoimmune hemolytic anemia). The cell
damage in type II reactions is produced by (1) direct cell lysis after
complete complement cascade activation, (2) increased phagocy-
tosis by macrophages, or (3) killer T-cell lymphocytes producing
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic effects. Examples of
type II reactions in humans are ABO-incompatible transfusion
reactions, drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia, and heparin-
induced thrombocytopenia.
Type BBB Reactions (Immune
Complex Reactions)
Type III reactions result from circulating soluble antigens and
antibodies that bind to form insoluble complexes that deposit in
the microvasculature (QM Video 9-1, Fig. 9-5). Complement is
activated, and neutrophils are localized to the site of complement
deposition to produce tissue damage. Type III reactions include
classic serum sickness observed after snake antisera or antithy-
mocyte globulin, and immune complex vascular injury, and may
occur through mechanisms of protamine-mediated pulmonary
vasoconstriction.1
Type IIV Reactions (Delayed
Hypersensitivi ty Reactions)
Type IV reactions result from the interactions of sensitized lym-
phocytes with specific antigens (Fig. 9-6). Delayed hypersen-
sitivity reactions are mainly mononuclear, manifest in 18 to
24 hours, peak at 40 to 80 hours, and disappear in 72 to 96 hours.
Antigen-lymphocyte binding produces lymphokine synthesis,
lymphocyte proliferation, and generation of cytotoxic T cells,
attracting macrophages and other inflammatory cells. Cytotoxic T
cells are produced specifically to kill target cells that bear antigens
identical to those that triggered the reaction. This form of immu-
nity is important in tissue rejection, graft-versus-host reactions,
contact dermatitis (e.g., poison ivy), and tuberculin immunity.
Intraoperative Allergic Reactions
Understanding perioperative anaphylaxis is important because of i 5
the potential for morbidity and mortality (^ NICV 9-2).13 How-
ever, most estimates of the incidence are based on retrospective
data, which may account for variability in the incidence. The risk
of perioperative anaphylaxis is reported as between 1:3,500 and
1:20,000, with a mortality rate of 4% and an additional 2% surviv-
ing with severe brain damage.13,14 More than 90% of the allergic
reactions evoked by intravenous drugs occur within 5 minutes
of administration. In the anesthetized patient, the most common
life-threatening manifestation of an allergic reaction is circula-
tory collapse, reflecting vasodilation and decreased venous return
(Table 9-3). The only manifestation of an allergic reaction may
be refractory hypotension. Portier and Richet first used the word
anaphylaxis (from ana, “against,” and prophylaxis, “protection”) to

cells to produce delayed tissue injury.

describe the profound shock and resulting death that sometimes
occurred in dogs immediately after a second challenge with a for-
eign antigen.15 When life-threatening allergic reactions mediated
by antibodies occur, they are defined as anaphylactic. Although
the term anaphylactoid has been used in the past to describe non-
immunologic reactions, this term is now rarely used.
Anaphylactic Reactions
IgE-Mediated Pathophysiology
Antigen binding to IgE antibodies initiates anaphylaxis Video
9-2, Fig. 9-7). Prior exposure to the antigen or a substance of
similar structure is needed to produce sensitization, although an
allergic history may be unknown to the patient. On reexposure,
binding of the antigen to bridge two immunospecific IgE anti-
bodies found on the surfaces of mast cells and basophils releases
stored mediators, including histamine, tryptase, and chemotactic
factors.13,16,17 Arachidonic acid metabolites (leukotrienes and pros-
taglandins), kinins, and cytokines are subsequently synthesized and
released in response to cellular activation.18 The released media-
tors produce a symptom complex of bronchospasm and upper air-
way edema in the respiratory system, vasodilation and increased
capillary permeability in the cardiovascular system, and urticaria in
the cutaneous system. Different mediators are released from mast
cells and basophils after activation.
Molecular Mediators of Anaphylaxis
Histamine stimulates H1; H2, and H3 receptors. HT receptor activa-
tion releases endothelium-derived relaxing factor (nitric oxide)
from vascular endothelium, increases capillary permeability, and
contracts airway and vascular smooth muscle.16,19 H2 receptor
activation causes gastric secretion, inhibits mast cell activation,
and contributes to vasodilation. When injected into the skin, his-
tamine produces the classic wheal (increased capillary permeabil-
ity producing tissue edema) and flare (cutaneous vasodilation)
response in humans.20,21 Histamine undergoes rapid metabolism
in humans by the enzymes histamine N-methyltransferase and
diamine oxidase found in endothelial cells.
Peptide Mediators of Anaphylaxis
Factors are released from mast cells and basophils that cause
granulocyte migration (chemotaxis) and collection at the site of
the inflammatory stimulus.17,18 Eosinophilic chemotactic factor
of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) is a small-molecular-weight peptide che-
motactic for eosinophils.22 Although the exact role of ECF-A or

Figure 9-7 During anaphylaxis (type I immediate hypersensitivity reaction), (1) antigen enters a patient during anesthesia through a parenteral
route. (2) It bridges two IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells or basophils. In a calcium-dependent and energy-dependent process, cells release
various substances—histamine, eosinophilic chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and kinins. (3) These released medi-
ators produce the characteristic effects in the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and cutaneous systems. The most severe and life-threatening effects of the
vasoactive mediators occur in the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. (Courtesy of Jerrold H. Levy. In: Levy JH. Identification and Treatment of
Anaphylaxis: Mechanisms of Action and Strategies for Treatment Under General Anesthesia. Smith Laboratories; 1983.)
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
the eosinophil in acute allergic response is unclear, eosinophils
release enzymes that can inactivate histamine and leukotrienes.18
In addition, a neutrophilic chemotactic factor is released that
causes chemotaxis and activation.18'23 Neutrophil activation may
be responsible for recunent manifestations of anaphylaxis.
Arachidonic Acid Metabolites
Leukotrienes and prostaglandins are synthesized after mast cell
activation from arachidonic acid metabolism of phospholipid
cell membranes through either lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase
pathways.22 The classic slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis is
a combination of leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4. Leukotrienes pro-
duce bronchoconstriction (more intense than that produced by
histamine), increased capillary permeability, vasodilation, coro-
nary vasoconstriction, and myocardial depression.24 Prostaglan-
dins are potent mast cell mediators that produce vasodilation,
bronchospasm, pulmonary hypertension, and increased capillary
permeability. Prostaglandin D2, the major metabolite of mast cells,
produces bronchospasm and vasodilation. Elevated plasma levels
of thromboxane B2 (the metabolite of thromboxane A2), also a
prostaglandin synthesized by mast cells as well as by PMNs, have
been demonstrated after protamine reactions associated with pul-
monary hypertension.
Kinins
Small peptides called kinins are synthesized in mast cells and
basophils to produce vasodilation, increased capillary permeabil-
ity, and bronchoconstriction. Kinins can stimulate vascular endo-
thelium to release vasoactive factors, including prostacyclin, and
endothelial-derived relaxing factors such as nitric oxide.
Platelet-Activating Factor
Platelet-activating factor (PAF), an unstored lipid synthesized
in activated human mast cells, is a potent biologic material. PAF
aggregates and activates human platelets, and perhaps leukocytes,
to release inflammatory products. PAF levels were significantly
higher in patients with anaphylaxis than in controls, and were
correlated with the severity of anaphylaxis.23
Recognition of Anaphylaxis
The onset and severity of the reaction relate to the mediator’s
specific end-organ effects. Antigenic challenge in a sensitized
individual usually produces immediate clinical manifestations of
anaphylaxis, but the onset may be delayed 2 to 20 minutes.24-27
The reaction may include some or all of the symptoms and signs
listed in Table 9-3. Individuals vary in their manifestations and
course of anaphylaxis. A spectrum of reactions exists, ranging
from minor clinical changes to the full-blown syndrome leading
to death.24,28 The enigma of anaphylaxis lies in the unpredictabil-
ity of happening, the severity of the attack, and the lack of prior
allergic history.
Non-lgE-Mediated Reactions
Other immunologic and nonimmunologic mechanisms release
many of the mediators previously discussed independent of IgE,
creating a clinical syndrome identical to anaphylaxis. Specific
pathways important in producing the same clinical manifestations
are considered later.
Complement Activation
Complement activation follows both immunologic (antibody
mediated; i.e., classic pathway) or nonimmunologic (alternative)

pathways to include a series of multimolecular, self-assembling
proteins that release biologically active complement fragments of
C3 and C5.9,10 C3a and C5a are called anaphylatoxins because they
release histamine from mast cells and basophils, contract smooth
muscle, increase capillary permeability, and cause interleukin
synthesis (Table 9-4). C5a interacts with specific high-affinity
receptors on PMNs and platelets, causing leukocyte chemotaxis,
aggregation, and activation.9,10 Aggregated leukocytes embolize to
various organs, producing microvascular occlusion and liberation
of inflammatory products, such as arachidonic acid metabolites,
oxygen free radicals, and lysosomal enzymes (Fig. 9-8). Antibod-
ies of the IgG class directed against antigenic determinants or
granulocyte surfaces can also produce leukocyte aggregation.29
These antibodies are called leukoagglutinins. Investigators have
associated complement activation and PMN aggregation in pro-
ducing the clinical expression of transfusion reactions, pulmo-
nary vasoconstriction after protamine reactions, adult respiratory
distress syndrome, and septic shock.1

Angioedema can also occur from allergic reactions but also from
complement deficiency states.11 Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is
an example of the complement deficiency state that can present
with life-threatening episodes of airway edema and gastrointestinal
edema/diarrhea requiring emergency or urgent interventions. Sev-
eral variants of HAE exist that occur due to unopposed activation
of multiple kinins and mediators, including kallikrein and brady-
kinin, causing increased vascular permeability and edema.11 Older
treatment was anabolic steroids and antifibrinolytics. Cl esterase
inhibitor (Cl-INH) concentrates are licensed in the United States
for use in HAE patients, one for prophylaxis (Cinryze, ViroPharma,
administered every 3 or 4 days for routine prophylaxis against
angioedema attacks in HAE patients) and the other for treating
acute abdominal and facial HAE attacks (Berinert P, CSL Behring).11
Other novel agents including kinin pathway modulator, ecallantide
(Kalbitor, Dyax), and bradykinin antagonists (Icatibant, Shire) are
also licensed in the United States for treating HAE attacks.11
Nonimmunologic Release of Histamine
6 Many diverse molecules administered during the perioperative
period release histamine in a dose-dependent, nonimmunologic
fashion (Table 9-5 and Fig. 9-9).1 The mechanisms involved in
nonimmunologic histamine release are not well understood,
but represent selective mast cell and not basophil activation
(Fig. 9-1O).30,31 Human cutaneous mast cells are the only cell
population that releases histamine in response to both drugs
and endogenous stimuli (neuropeptides). Nonimmunologic his-
tamine release may involve mast cell activation through specific
cell-signaling activation (Fig. 9-11). Different molecular struc-
tures release histamine in humans, which suggests that different

mechanisms are involved. Histamine release is not dependent on
the (l-receptor because fentanyl and sufentanil, the most potent
fl-receptor agonists clinically available, do not release histamine
in human skin.32 Although the newer muscle relaxants may be
more potent at the neuromuscular junction, drugs that are mast
cell degranulators are equally capable of releasing histamine.33 On
an equimolar basis, atracurium is as potent as d-tubocurarine or
metocurine, in its ability to degranulate' mast cells.33 Although
these agents are no longer used clinically, the aminosteroidal
agents such as rocuronium and pancuronium at clinically recom-
mended doses have minimal effects on histamine release.34,35

Anti-lgE
Figure 9-11 Different mechanisms of mediator release from human
cutaneous mast cells stimulated immunologically by anti-lgE and by
nonimmunologic stimuli with substance P. Anti-lgE stimulation, like
antigen stimulation, initiates the release of histamine, prostaglandin D2
(PGD2), or leukotriene C4 (LTC4) by a mechanism that takes 5 minutes to
reach completion and requires the influx of intracellular calcium. Non-
immunologic activation with drugs or substance P releases histamine
but not PGD2 or LTC4 by a mechanism that is complete within 15 sec-
onds and uses calcium mobilized from intracellular sources. (Adapted

lgE and substance P. Lab Invest. 1990;63(4):502-510.)
Antihistamine pretreatment before administration of drugs known
to release histamine in humans does not inhibit histamine release;
rather, the antihistamines compete with histamine at the receptor and
may attenuate decreases in systemic vascular resistance.1 However,
the effect of any drug on systemic vascular resistance may depend on
other factors in addition to histamine release.
Treatment Plan
7	A plan for treating anaphylactic reactions must be established
before the event. Airway maintenance, 100% oxygen adminis-
tration, intravascular volume expansion, and epinephrine are
essential to treat the hypotension and hypoxemia that result from
vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and bronchospasm.1
Table 9-6 lists a protocol for managing anaphylaxis during general
anesthesia, with representative doses for a 70-kg adult. Therapy
must be titrated to cardiopulmonary stability with monitoring.1
Severe reactions need aggressive therapy and may be protracted,
with persistent hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, lower
respiratory obstruction, or laryngeal obstruction that may per-
sist 5 to 32 hours despite vigorous therapy. All patients who have
experienced an anaphylactic reaction should be admitted to an
intensive care unit for 24 hours of monitoring because manifesta-
tions may recur after successful treatment.
Initial Therapy
Although it may not be possible to stop antigen administration,
limiting antigen administration may prevent further mast cell and
basophil activation.
Maintain Airway and Administer 100% Oxygen
Profound ventilation-perfusion abnormalities producing hypox-
emia can occur with anaphylactic reactions. Always administer
100% oxygen with ventilatory support as needed. Arterial blood
gas values may be useful to follow during resuscitation.

Discontinue All Anesthetic Drugs
Inhalational anesthetic drugs are not the bronchodilators of
choice in treating bronchospasm after anaphylaxis, especially
during hypotension. These drugs interfere with the body’s com-
pensatory response to cardiovascular collapse.
Provide Volume Expansion
Hypovolemia rapidly follows during anaphylactic shock with up
to 40% loss of intravascular fluid into the interstitial space dur-
ing reactions. Therefore, volume expansion is important with epi-
nephrine in correcting the acute hypotension. Initially, 2 to 4 L
of lactated Ringer’s solution, or colloid or normal saline, should
be administered, considering that an additional 25 to 50 mL/kg
may be necessary if hypotension persists. Refractory hypotension
after volume and epinephrine administration requires additional
hemodynamic monitoring. The use of transesophageal echocar-
diography for rapid assessment of intraventricular volume and
ventricular function, and to determine other occult causes of acute
cardiovascular dysfunction, can be important for accurate assess-
ment of intravascular volume and guidance of rational therapeutic
interventions.1 Fulminant noncardiogenic pulmonary edema with
loss of intravascular volume can occur after anaphylaxis. This con-
dition requires intravascular volume repletion with careful hemo-
dynamic monitoring until the capillary defect improves. Colloid
volume expansion has not proved to be more effective than crystal-
loid volume expansion for treating anaphylactic shock.
Administer Epinephrine
Epinephrine is the drug of choice when resuscitating patients
during anaphylactic shock. a-Adrenergic effects vasoconstrict to
reverse hypotension; P2-receptor stimulation bronchodilates and
inhibits mediator release by increasing cyclic adenosine monophos-
phate (cAMP) in mast cells and basophils. The route of epinephrine
9 The Allergic Response
administration and the dose depend on the patient’s condition. Rapid
and timely intervention is important when treating anaphylaxis.
Furthermore, patients under general anesthesia may have altered
sympathoadrenergic responses to acute anaphylactic shock, whereas
the patient under spinal or epidural anesthesia maybe partially sym-
pathectomized and may need even larger doses of catecholamines.
In hypotensive patients, 5- to 10-p.g boluses of epinephrine
should be administered intravenously and incrementally titrated
to restore blood pressure. (This dose of epinephrine can be
obtained with 0.05 to 0.1 ml of a 1:10,000 dilution [100 p.g/mL]
or by mixing 2 mg epinephrine with 250 mL of fluid to yield an
8	|ig/mL solution.) Additional volume and incrementally increased
doses of epinephrine should be administered until hypotension
is corrected. Although infusion is an ideal method of adminis-
tering epinephrine, it is usually impossible to infuse the drug
through peripheral intravenous access lines during acute volume
resuscitation. With cardiovascular collapse, full intravenous car-
diopulmonary resuscitative doses of epinephrine, 0.1 to 1.0 mg,
should be administered and repeated until hemodynamic stabil-
ity resumes. Patients with laryngeal edema without hypotension
should receive subcutaneous epinephrine. Epinephrine should
not be administered IV to patients with normal blood pressures.
Secondary Treatment
Antihistamines
Because receptors mediate many of the adverse effects of his-
tamine, the intravenous administration of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg of an
Eh antagonist, such as diphenhydramine, may be useful in treat-
ing acute anaphylaxis. Antihistamines do not inhibit anaphylac-
tic reactions or histamine release, but compete with histamine at
receptor sites. Hi antagonists are indicated in all forms of anaphy-
laxis. The Hx antagonists available for parenteral administration
may have antidopaminergic effects and should be given slowly
to prevent precipitous hypotension in potentially hypovolemic
patients.1 The indications for administering an H2 antagonist once
anaphylaxis has occurred remain unclear.
Catecholamines
Epinephrine infusions may be useful in patients with persistent
hypotension or bronchospasm after initial resuscitation.1 Epi-
nephrine infusions should be started at 0.05 to 0.1 pg/kg/min
(5 to 10 pg/min) and titrated to correct hypotension. Norepineph-
rine infusions may be needed in patients with refractory hypo-
tension due to decreased systemic vascular resistance. It may be
started at 0.05 to 0.1 pg/kg/min (5 to 10 pg/min) and adjusted to
correct hypotension.1
Bronchodilators
Inhaled P-adrenergic agents include inhaled albuterol or terbu-
taline if bronchospasm is a major feature.36 Inhaled ipratropium
may be especially useful for the treatment of bronchospasm in
patients receiving P-adrenergic blockers.36 Special adaptors allow
administration of bronchodilators through the endotracheal tube.
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory effects mediated by mul-
tiple mechanisms, including altering the activation and migration
of other inflammatory cells (i.e., PMNs) after an acute reaction.
Consider infusing high-dose corticosteroids early in therapy,
although beneficial effects are delayed at least 4 to 6 hours. 6
Despite their unproven usefulness in treating acute reactions, they
are often administered as adjuncts to therapy when refractory
bronchospasm or refractory shock occurs after resuscitative ther-
apy. Although the exact corticosteroid dose and preparation are
unclear, investigators have recommended 0.25 to 1 g intravenously
of hydrocortisone in IgE-mediated reactions. Alternatively, 1 to
2 g of methylprednisolone (30 to 35 mg/kg) intravenously may be
useful in reactions believed to be complement mediated, such as
catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction after protamine transfu-
sion reactions. Administering corticosteroids after an anaphylactic
reaction may also be important in attenuating the late-phase reac-
tions reported occurring 12 to 24 hours after anaphylaxis.
Airway Evaluation
Because profound laryngeal edema can occur, the airway should
be evaluated before extubation of the trachea. Persistent facial
edema suggests airway edema. The tracheas of these patients
should remain intubated until the edema subsides. Developing
a significant air leak after endotracheal tube cuff deflation and
before extubation of the trachea is useful in assessing airway
patency. If there is any question of airway edema, direct laryngos-
copy should be performed before the trachea is extubated.
Refractory Hypotension
Vasopressin is an important drug for refractory shock, includ-
ing vasodilatory shock associated with anaphylaxis. Vasodilatory
shock is characterized by hypotension association with high car-
diac output and is thought to be due to the multiple activation of
vasodilator mechanisms and the inability of a-adrenergic mecha-
nisms to compensate. Starting doses to consider are 0.01 units/min
as an infusion. Vasopressin may attenuate pathologic-induced
vasodilation and is used extensively in patients who are vasople-
gia following mediator-induced septic shock. Further, additional
monitoring, including echocardiography should be considered in
patients with refractory hypotension to further evaluate cardiac
function or hypovolemia.
Perioperative Management
of the Patient with Allergies
Allergic drug reactions account for 6% to 10% of all adverse
reactions, and the risk of an allergic drug reaction occurring
is approximately 1% to 3% for most drugs, and around 5%
of adults in the United States may be allergic to one or more
drugs.37-39 Unfortunately, patients often refer to adverse drug
effects as being allergic in nature. For example, opioid admin-
istration can produce nausea, vomiting, or even local release of
histamine along the vein of administration. Patients will say that
they are “allergic” to a specific drug when their adverse reaction
is independent of allergy. Nearly 15% of adults in the United
States believe that they are allergic to specific medication(s)
and may be denied treatment with an indicated drug. To under-
stand allergic reactions, the spectrum of adverse reactions to
drugs needs to be considered.
Predictable adverse drug reactions account for about 80% of
adverse drug effects. They are often dose dependent, related to
known pharmacologic actions of the drug, and typically occur in
normal patients. Most serious, predictable adverse drug reactions
are toxic and are directly related to the drug in the body (overdos-
age) or an unintentional route of administration (e.g., lidocaine-
induced seizures or cardiovascular collapse). Side effects are the
most common adverse drug reactions and are undesirable pharma-
cologic actions of the drugs occurring at usual prescribed dosages.
Most anesthetic drugs present multiple side effects that can pro-
duce precipitous hypotension. For example, morphine dilates the
venous capacitance bed, thereby decreasing preload; releases his-
tamine from cutaneous mast cells, thereby producing arterial and
venous dilation; slows the heart rate; and decreases sympathetic
198
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
tone. However, the net effects of morphine on blood pressure
and myocardial function depend on the patient’s blood volume,
sympathetic tone, and ventricular function. Hypotension rapidly
develops in a volume-depleted trauma patient in pain who is given
morphine. Drug interactions also represent important predictable
adverse drug reactions. Intravenous fentanyl administration to a
patient who has just received intravenous benzodiazepines or other
sedative-hypnotic drugs may produce precipitous hypotension
that results from decreased sympathetic tone or direct vasodilation
from propofol administration.40 This represents a dose-dependent,
predictable adverse drug reaction independent of allergy.
Unpredictable adverse drug reactions are usually dose-
independent and usually not related to the drug’s pharmacologic
actions, butare often related to the immunologic response (allergy)
of the individual. On occasion, adverse reactions can be related to
genetic differences (i.e., idiosyncratic) in a susceptible individ-
ual with an isolated genetic enzyme deficiency. In most allergic
drug reactions, an immunologic mechanism is present or, more
often, presumed. Determining whether the causing event involves
a reaction between the drug or drug metabolites with drug-
specific antibodies or sensitized T lymphocytes is often imprac-
tical. Without direct immunologic evidence, which may be helpful
in distinguishing an allergic reaction from other adverse reactions,
including allergic reactions that occur in only a small percentage
of patients receiving the drug, the clinical manifestations do not
resemble known pharmacologic actions. In the absence of prior
drug exposure, allergic symptoms rarely appear after less than
1 week of continuous treatment. After sensitization, the reaction
develops rapidly on reexposure to the drug. In general, drugs that
have been administered without complications for several months
or longer are rarely responsible for producing drug allergy. The
time between exposure to the drug and noticed manifestations is
often the most vital information in deciding which drugs admin-
istered were the cause of a suspected allergic reaction.
Although the reaction may produce a life-threatening response
in the cardiopulmonary system (anaphylaxis), various cutaneous
manifestations, fever, and pulmonary reactions have been attrib-
uted to drug hypersensitivity. Usually, the reaction may be repro-
duced by small doses of the suspected drug or other agents having
similar or cross-reacting chemical structures. On occasion, drug-
specific antibodies or lymphocytes have been identified that react
with the suspected drug, although the relationship is seldom diag-
nostically useful in practice. Even when an immune response to a
drug is demonstrated, it may not be associated with a clinical aller-
gic reaction. As with adverse drug reactions in general, the reaction
usually subsides within several days of discontinuation of the drug.
Immunologic Mechanisms of Drug Allergy
Different immunologic responses to any antigen can occur. Drugs
have been associated with all the immunologic mechanisms pro-
posed by Gell and Coombs. Although more than one mechanism
may contribute to a particular reaction, any one can occur. Peni-
cillin may produce different reactions in different patients or a
spectrum of reactions in the same patient. In one patient, penicil-
lin can produce anaphylaxis (type I reaction), hemolytic anemia
(type II reaction), serum sickness (type III reaction), and contact
dermatitis (type IV reaction).5,6 Therefore, any one antigen has
the ability to produce a diffuse spectrum of allergic responses
in humans. Why some patients have localized rashes or angio-
edema in response to penicillin whereas others suffer complete
cardiopulmonary collapse is unknown. Most anesthetic drugs and
agents administered perioperatively have been reported to pro-
duce anaphylactic reactions (Table 9-7).31'39 Muscle relaxants are
the most common drugs responsible for evoking intraoperative

allergic reactions. In this regard, there is cross-sensitivity between
succinylcholine and the nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Unex-
plained intraoperative cardiovascular collapse has been attributed
to anaphylaxis triggered by latex (natural rubber).
Life-threatening allergic reactions are potentially thought to
occur more likely in patients with a history of allergy, atopy, or
asthma, although this concept is also controversial and in part
based on older data.41 Nevertheless, because the incidence is low,
the history is not a reliable predictor that an allergic reaction will
occur and does not mandate that such patients should be investi-
gated or pretreated or that specific drugs be selected or avoided.
Although different mechanisms have been proposed, no one
theory has been proved. The drugs and foreign substances listed
in Table 9-7 may have both immunologic and nonimmunologic
mechanisms for adverse drug reactions in humans.
Evaluation of Patients with
Allergic Reactions
Identifying the drug responsible for a suspected allergic reaction
depends on circumstantial evidence, suggesting the temporal
sequence of drug administration. Conventional in vivo and in vitro
methods of diagnosing allergic reactions to most anesthetic drugs
9 The Allergic Response
are unavailable or not applicable. The most important factor in
diagnosis is the awareness of the physician that an untoward event
may be related to a drug the patient received. The physician must
always be aware of the capacity of any drug to produce an aller-
gic reaction. The history is important when evaluating whether an
adverse drug reaction is allergic and whether the drug can be read-
ministered. Although a prior allergic reaction to the drug in ques-
tion is important, this is rarely the case. Direct challenge of a patient
with a test dose of the drug is the only way to prove a reaction,
but this is potentially dangerous and not recommended. Although
anesthesiologists often administer small test doses of anesthetic
drugs, these are pharmacologic test doses and have nothing to do
with immunologic dosages. The demonstration of drug-specific IgE
antibodies is accepted as evidence that the patient may be at risk for
anaphylaxis if the drug is administered. Different clinical tests are of
historical interest, and few of them are available to confirm or diag-
nose drug allergy, but these are considered in the following section.
Testing fog- Allergy
After an anaphylactic reaction, it is important to identify the
causative agent to prevent readministration. When one particu-
lar drug has been administered, and there is a clear correlation
between the time of administration and the occurrence of a reac-
tion, testing may be unnecessary, and general avoidance of the
drug should be instituted. However, when patients have simul-
taneously received multiple drugs (e.g., an opioid, muscle relax-
ant, hypnotic, and antibiotic), it is often difficult to prove which
particular drug caused the reaction. Further, the reaction might
have been caused by the vehicle or by one of the preservatives.
For patients who want to know which drug was responsible and
for patients scheduled for subsequent procedures, some degree of
allergy evaluation should be undertaken to evaluate the drug at
risk. Unfortunately, few laboratory tests exist for anesthetic drugs;
therefore, the available allergy tests are discussed.
Leukocyte Histamine Release
Leukocyte histamine is performed by incubating the patient’s
leukocytes with the offending drug and measuring histamine
release as a marker for basophil activation, although false-positive
results can occur. This test is not easy to perform, although varia-
tions allow the use of whole blood instead of isolated PMNs, and
is generally not available nor used.
In Vitro Immunologic Testing
The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measures
antigen-specific antibodies. The ELISA evaluates immunospecific
IgE directed against the antigen in question by adding an anti-IgE
coupled to an enzyme such as peroxidase that acts as a chromogen.
A colorless substrate is acted on by peroxidase to produce a colored
byproduct. The ELISA has been used to prove IgE antibodies to
proteins such as protamine, has been developed to screen for other
antibodies to diverse agents, and has become the mainstay of immu-
nologic testing. Although antibodies can occur, patients may be
asymptomatic. An older test previously used was the radioallergo-
sorbent test (RAST), which used radiolabeled antibodies directed
against human IgE and was counted in a scintillation counter, and
has been largely replaced by ELISA assays. Major limitations to in
vitro immunologic testing too many anesthetic drugs include the
commercial availability of the drug prepared as an antigen.
Intradermal Testing (Skin Testing)
Skin testing is the method most often used in patients after
anaphylactic reaction to anesthetic drugs after the history has
suggested the relevant antigens for testing.42 Within minutes
after antigen introduction, histamine released from cutaneous
mast cells causes vasodilation (flare) and localized edema from
increased vascular permeability (wheal). Fisher suggested that
this is a simple, safe, and useful method of establishing a diagnosis
in most cases of anaphylactic reactions occurring in the perioper-
ative period. If the strict protocols established by Fisher are used,
intradermal reactions are helpful.42 Intradermal testing is of no
value in reactions to contrast media or colloid volume expanders.
Cross-sensitivity between drugs of similar structures can often be
evaluated based on skin testing.
Agents Implicated in Allergic Reactions
Any drug or biologic agent can cause anaphylaxis in a patient.
However, the agents most often implicated in the perioperative
period include antibiotics, blood products, chlorhexidine, neu-
romuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs), polypeptides (aprotinin,
latex, and protamine), and intravascular volume expanders. Most
of the information about perioperative anaphylaxis is from Austra-
lia, Europe, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand, where centers
have existed for many years to investigate perioperative anaphy-
laxis when it occurs.43-48 In one of the largest reports, periopera-
tive anaphylaxis was evaluated over an 8-year period from 1997
to 2004 in France. Among the 2,516 patients with anaphylaxis,
IgE-mediated reactions occurred in 1,816 cases (72.2%). The most
common causes for the IgE-mediated events were NMBDs in 58%
(n = 1067), latex in 19.6% (n = 316), and antibiotics in 12.8%
(n = 236).49 One of the concerns regarding NMBA allergy is that
if patients are allergic to a muscle relaxant, there is a potential for
cross-reactivity because of the similarity of the active site, a qua-
ternary ammonium molecule, among the different types of relax-
ants, and alternatives cannot be chosen without some degree of
immunologic testing. Because of the different immune and non-
immune causes of reported anaphylactic reactions, the periopera-
tive incidence varies worldwide, with reports of 1 in 1,250 to 1 in
18,600 procedures with inconsistency about the underlying agent
responsible. As noted, NMBA reactions are common in France but
not in Denmark or the United States.50
From the U.STNorth American perspective, only a few reports
note either the incidence or agents implicated for perioperative
anaphylaxis. However, European reports suggest the most fre-
quent agent reported for perioperative IgE-mediated anaphylaxis
is NMBAs.51 A report from 2011 in the United States examined a
skin test database of 38 patients with perioperative anaphylaxis
who were tested to medications implicated in the reactions.52
The history obtained by an allergist, skin test results, and trypt-
ase measurements were reported.52 Of note, 40% of the surgical
procedures were aborted, and 58% of events resulted in intensive
care unit admissions, suggesting the severity of the responses.52
Of the 38 patients, 18 were considered IgE-mediated reactions
by skin testing, 6 were non-IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions
determined by elevated tryptase levels and negative skin testing,
and 14 were probable non-IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions
because tryptase levels were normal or not obtained and skin
testing was negative. Of the IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions,
antibiotics were the causative agents in half of the patients, while
NMBAs were implicated solely as a likely causative agent in only
one reaction. The authors noted causative agents could not be
determined in the other half of the patients.52 The authors identi-
fied only one true IgE-mediated reaction to an NMBA; however,
another patient had positive skin tests to three agents, including
vecuronium, propofol, and cefazolin, making the diagnosis uncer-
tain. A previous Danish study reported 68 patients, of which 36
underwent complete investigations with in vitro resting and skin
testing, and found that only one patient tested positive for NMBAs

200
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
(4.8%: 1/21). At the same time, chlorhexidine accounted for
19.1% of reactions and antibiotics, 14.3%.53 In the current study,
chlorhexidine was tested in only 4% of cases and may account for
some of the undiagnosed reactions with elevated tryptase.52
Because of this information, antibiotics, latex, and NMBAs will be
considered in more detail, along with local anesthetic (LA) agents.
Antibiotics
Most surgical patients receive an antibiotic that includes a cepha-
losporin or vancomycin for prophylaxis. Despite their widespread
use, the incidence of antibiotic allergy and its reported prevalence
varies widely, as cutaneous manifestations are often the presenting
reaction.39 The risk of anaphylaxis to penicillins is low, as most
of the widely quoted data is based on older reports, and penicil-
lin per se is rarely used.38,39'54-57 Further, anaphylaxis to cephalo-
sporins can occur independendy without a penicillin allergy, and
antibiotics are the most common agent implicated in periopera-
tive anaphylaxis.52,55 In surgical patients, vancomycin will often
be used for prophylaxis in patients with a history of penicillin
allergy, but vancomycin is a potent histamine-releasing agent that
can cause severe hypotension and flushing on administration,
especially with rapid infusion.30,31
As reviewed previously, managing the patient with a penicillin
allergy history when the surgeon requests cephalosporin admin-
istration is still unclear based on reported data.1,55-57 Although
previous reports suggest cross-reactivity to cephalosporins among
penicillin-allergic patients is high and suggest choosing another
agent, a practice that developed from case reports of anaphylaxis
following first-generation cephalosporins together with in vitro
and skin testing, which showed extensive cross-reactivity between
penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins. However, the risk
of acute cephalosporin reactions among patients with positive
penicillin skin tests is reported to be -4.4%, compared with 0.6%
among patients with negative penicillin skin tests.56,57 Anaphy-
lactic reactors were selectively omitted from these open studies.
Further, an allergic reaction to a cephalosporin may occur inde-
pendendy of prior penicillin sensitization. Although most patients
who have a history of penicillin allergy will tolerate cephalospo-
rins, indiscriminate administration cannot be recommended,
especially for patients who have had serious acute reactions to any
P-lactam antibiotic.1,39 Penicillin skin testing, when available, can
be useful in identifying the 85% of patients with histories of peni-
cillin allergy who no longer have (or never had) IgE antibodies to
major and minor determinants and are therefore at negligible risk
of cephalosporin reactions. For the remaining patients who are
skin test positive, gradual escalation of the first dose of a cepha-
losporin under careful observation will further mitigate against
uncommon but potentially serious acute reactions.
The risk versus benefit of specific antibiotic use should be con-
sidered with known antibiotic allergies. Often for surgical wound
prophylaxis, there is flexibility in the choice of specific antibiotics
compared to critically ill hospitalized patients who require specific
antibiotic treatment. Potential management strategies suggest if a
patient has a penicillin allergy history consistent with anaphylaxis
and penicillin skin testing is unavailable, then cephalosporins
should be used with caution, with graded dose escalation of the
first dose. A patient who has experienced an allergic reaction to a
specific cephalosporin should probably not receive that cephalo-
sporin again. However, the risk of an acute reaction when a differ-
ent cephalosporin is administered appears to be low, but systemic
evaluations of reaction risks when administering other cephalo-
sporins or P-lactam antibiotics to patients with IgE antibodies to
a particular cephalosporin are not available. Unfortunately, patient

histories are often unreliable in this circumstance. ' ’
Latex Allergy
For the anesthesiologist, latex represents an environmental agent
often implicated as an important cause of perioperative anaphy-
laxis (^ NICV 9-3). Latex is the milky sap derived from the tree
Hevea brasiliensis, to which multiple agents, including preserva-
tives, accelerators, and antioxidants, are added to make the final
rubber product. Latex is present in a variety of different products.
Latex allergy is an IgE-dependent immediate hypersensitivity
reaction to latex proteins. The first case of an allergic reaction
because of latex was reported in 1979 and was manifested by con-
tact urticaria. In 1989, the first reports of intraoperative anaphy-
laxis because of latex were reported.
Health care workers and children with spina bifida, urogenital , 9
abnormalities, or certain food allergies have also been recognized
as people at increased risk for anaphylaxis to latex. Brown and
colleagues reported a 24% incidence of irritant or contact derma-
titis and a 12.5% incidence of latex-specific IgE positivity in anes-
thesiologists. Of this group, 10% were clinically asymptomatic,
although IgE positive.58 A history of atopy was also a significant
risk factor for latex sensitization. Brown and colleagues suggested
that these people are in their early stages of sensitization, and
perhaps, by avoiding latex exposure, their progression to symp-
tomatic disease can be prevented.58 Patients allergic to bananas,
avocados, and kiwis have also been reported to have antibodies
that cross-react with latex.59,60 Multiple attempts are being made to
reduce latex exposure to both health care workers and patients. If
latex allergy occurs, there should be strict avoidance of latex from
gloves and other sources, following recommendations as reported
by Holzman.61,62 Although latex was previously a common envi-
ronmental antigen, ongoing effort by suppliers of hospital equip-
ment has significantly reduced latex exposure in recent years.
More importandy, anesthesiologists must be prepared to treat
the life-threatening cardiopulmonary collapse that occurs in ana-
phylaxis as previously discussed. The most important preventive
therapy is to avoid antigen exposure; although clinicians have
used pretreatment with antihistamine (diphenhydramine and
cimetidine) and corticosteroids, there are no data in the literature
to suggest that pretreatment prevents anaphylaxis or decreases its
severity.1 Patients in whom latex allergy is suspected should be
referred to an allergist for proper evaluation and potential testing
for definitive diagnosis. When this is not possible, patients should
be treated as if they were latex allergic, and the antigen avoided.
Patients with a documented history of latex allergy should wear
Medic Alert bracelets.
Local Anesthetics
Skin testing to LAs is considered a direct challenge or provoca-
tive dose testing. LA drugs are injected in increasing quantities
under controlled circumstances. This testing decides if the person
can safely receive amide derivatives (e.g., lidocaine) and can also
be used to decide if the person is sensitive to para-aminobenzoic
ester agents (e.g., procaine, tetracaine). Because the immediate
hypersensitivity reactions to LAs are unknown, they are com-
monly regarded as “pseudoallergic” or “nonimmune type” ana-
phylaxis, as immunologically mediated reactions have rarely been
observed with positive skin-prick tests.63 Other ingredients in LA
preparations have to be considered as elicitors; for example, pre-
servatives like benzoates or sulfites or latex contaminants in injec-
tion bottles. Practical management of patients with a history of
LA reaction includes a careful allergy history and skin-prick and
intradermal tests. Undiluted LA solutions may elicit false-positive
intradermal test reactions. If prick and intradermal tests are nega-
tive, the procedure of subcutaneous provocation testing is applied
in a placebo-controlled manner. When patients are constantly
9 The Allergic Response
Hi
reacting to placebo, a regimen of “reverse placebo provocation”
with injection of an LA (verum) is applied while the patient is
informed about receiving placebo in order to “rule out psychoso-
matic involvement.” With this regimen, it is possible to eliminate
anxiousness and fear, and the patient has proof that he has toler-
ated the respective LA substance.63
However, the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected
allergy to LAs who have experienced a reaction remains contro-
versial. One of the largest reports of skin testing for LA allergy
evaluation is a retrospective chart review of patients following LA
skin testing who underwent prick and intradermal skin testing
followed by incremental subcutaneous and open subcutaneous
challenge.64 A total of 178 patients underwent 227 LA skin tests,
of which 220 (97%) were negative, and 214 (97%) had negative
challenge or probable non-IgE-mediated events during challenge
while three patients with six negative skin tests had a local reac-
tion during the challenge. Only seven skin tests per five patients
met the criteria for a positive skin test, and one patient had a
skin reaction without systemic effects, three patients had a nega-
tive subcutaneous challenge, and one patient did not undergo a
challenge. Overall, 98% of patients receiving Las after open sub-
cutaneous challenge tolerated the medications. The negative pre-
dictive value of the LA skin test was 97% with few positive skin
tests. Positive LA skin tests are uncommon and the LA skin tests
have an excellent negative predictive value.64
Neuromuscular Blocking and Reversal Agents
10 NMBAs have several unique molecular features that make them
potential antigens. All NMBAs are functionally divalent and are
thus capable of cross-linking cell-surface IgE and causing medi-
ator release from mast cells and basophils without binding or
haptenating to larger carrier molecules. NMBAs have also been
implicated in epidemiologic studies of anesthetic drug-induced
anaphylaxis. Epidemiologic data from France suggest that NMBAs
are responsible for 62% to 81% of reactions, depending on the
time period evaluated. NMBA allergy is more frequently reported
in females, with 75% of the reactions occurring in women.3,33
In more recent years, NMBAs, especially steroid-derived
agents, have been reported as potential causative agents of ana-
phylactic reactions during anesthesia. The data associating
NMBAs in the most recent reports from France are mainly based
on skin testing; however, studies have previously reported that
steroidal-derived NMBAs and other molecules produce false-
positive skin tests (i.e., weal and flare). One of the major problems
is that anaphylaxis to NMBAs is rare in the United States but has
been reported more often in Europe. Although suggestions have
been made that this is because of underreporting, the severity of
anaphylaxis and its sequelae to produce adverse outcomes make
this unlikely based on the current medicolegal climate that exists
in the United States. One of the only ways to explain this widely
divergent perspective is to understand how the diagnosis is made,
because the recommended threshold test concentrations have not
been defined, resulting in unreliable results.
We have previously reported that steroid-derived agents can
induce positive weal and flare responses independent of mast cell
degranulation, even at low concentrations, following intrader-
mal injection. This effect is likely because of a direct effect on the
cutaneous vasculature that occurs for most NMBAs at concentra-
tions as low as 10'* 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 M, using intradermal skin tests in 30 vol-
unteers. A positive cutaneous reaction without evidence of mast
cell degranulation was noted at low concentrations (100 |ig/mL)
of rocuronium in almost all the volunteers. We have used intra-
dermal injections to compare cutaneous effects of anesthetic and
other agents.
Other investigators have also reported similar results.
Because prick tests are often used for authenticating NMBAs
as causative drugs, Dhonneur and colleagues evaluated 30 vol-
unteers, using prick testing. Each subject received 10 prick
tests (50 |d.L) on both forearms.65 The investigators studied the
weal and flare responses to prick tests with rocuronium and
vecuronium, using four dilutions (1/1,000, 1/100, 1/10, and 1)
and two controls, and measured weal and flare immediately
after and at 15 minutes. They noted 50% and 40% of the sub-
jects had a positive skin reaction to undiluted rocuronium and
vecuronium, respectively. To avoid false-positive results, they
suggested that prick testing with rocuronium and vecuronium
should be performed in subjects who have experienced a hyper-
sensitivity reaction during anesthesia, with concentrations
below that commonly inducing positive reactions in anesthesia-
naive, healthy subjects (i.e., for men in a dilution of 1/10 and
for women in a dilution of 1/100).65 Guidelines for prick test-
ing that Have international agreement need to be established.
Many of these differences may explain the various incidences
of allergy to NMBAs among countries. Concentration-skin
response curves to rocuronium and vecuronium suggest that
prick tests should be performed with dilution of the commer-
cially available preparation. Female volunteers significantly
(P < .01) reacted to lower vecuronium and rocuronium concen-
trations more frequently than males. In female subjects, posi-
tive skin reactions were reported with dilutions of 1/100 of both
relaxants. In male subjects, positive skin reactions were noted
with the undiluted concentration, except for one volunteer who
reacted to rocuronium (1/10 dilution).65 Sugammadex, a novel
cyclodextrin structure that binds NMBAs for reversal, has also
been reported to produce anaphylaxis.66
Summary
Although the immune system functions to provide host defense,
it can respond inappropriately to produce hypersensitivity or
allergic reactions. A spectrum of life-threatening allergic reac-
tions to any drug or agent can occur in the perioperative period.
The enigma of these reactions lies in their unpredictable nature.
Certain patients undergoing high-risk procedures with multiple
blood product exposures are also at higher risk. However, a high
index of suspicion, prompt recognition, and appropriate and
aggressive therapy can help avoid a disastrous outcome.

1	The components of the anesthetic state include unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia, immobility, and attenuation
of autonomic responses to noxious stimulation.
2	Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) remains the most robust measurement and the standard for determining
the potency of volatile anesthetics (VAs).
3	Anesthetic interactions with membrane lipids may also contribute to anesthetic action. Emerging evidence indicates
that anesthetic effects on lipid nanodomains may modify functionally important lipid-protein interactions.
4	Direct interactions of anesthetic molecules with specific binding pockets on membrane proteins can account for most
of the observed cellular and behavioral effects of anesthetics. Protein interactions satisfy the Meyer-Overton rule
and provide the simplest explanation for compounds that deviate from this rule.
5	While current data still support the prevailing view that neuronal excitability is only slightly affected by general
anesthetics, this small effect may nevertheless contribute significantly to the clinical actions of VAs.
6	The synapse is generally thought to be the most likely relevant site of anesthetic action. Existing evidence indicates
that even at this one site, anesthetics produce various effects, including presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter
release, inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission, and enhancement of inhibitory neurotransmission. Furthermore,
the effects of anesthetics on synaptic function differ among various anesthetic agents, neurotransmitters, and
neuronal preparations.
7	The essential criteria for demonstrating a protein as an anesthetic target are (i) the function of the protein is
affected by the anesthetic at relevant concentrations; (ii) the functional alteration of the protein could plausibly
produce a component of anesthesia; (iii) genetic or pharmacologic manipulation of the protein alters sensitivity to
the anesthetic; and (iv) the protein binds to the anesthetic.
8	GABAa receptors meet all the criteria as a target for certain anesthetics.
9	Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels are inhibited by volatile and some intravenous
anesthetics and may contribute to their anesthetic effect.
10	Certain background K+ channels have electrophysiologic, genetic, and biochemical evidence implicating them as
relevant VA targets.
11	Some sodium and calcium channel subtypes are inhibited by VAs and these effects may be responsible in part for
inhibition of neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability.
12	The shaker potassium channel subtype (Kv1.2) is activated by VAs and has both genetic and biochemical evidence
implicating it as a relevant target.
13	NMDA glutamate receptors are inhibited by nitrous oxide and ketamine but mammalian genetic data is currently
insufficient to link this effect to anesthesia.

Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
14	VA inhibition of mitochondria and synaptic vesicle release machinery may also contribute to anesthesia.
15	While anesthetic action to produce immobility occurs largely at the spinal cord, specific molecular targets for
amnesia lie in the hippocampus.
16	Anesthetic-induced unconsciousness can be viewed as impairment of both arousal and awareness. These actions are
mediated by targets distributed across the brain stem, hypothalamus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex.
17	Anesthetic ablation of arousal relies on disruption of redundant subcortical systems that regulate sleep and patterns
of cortical activity.
18	Anesthetics alter the interaction of cortical networks responsible for cognitive functions and may thereby alter
awareness by limiting the capacity to both represent and integrate information.
The introduction of general anesthetics into clinical practice over
150 years ago stands as one of the seminal innovations of medi-
cine. This single discovery facilitated the development of mod-
em surgery and spawned the specialty of anesthesiology. Despite
the importance of general anesthetics and despite more than
100 years of active research, the molecular mechanisms respon-
sible for anesthetic action are not fully understood.
Why have the mechanisms of anesthesia been so difficult to
elucidate? Anesthetics, as a class of drugs, are challenging to study
for three major reasons:
1.	Anesthesia, by definition, is a change in the responses of an
intact animal to external stimuli. Making a definitive link
between anesthetic effects observed in vitro and the anes-
thetic state observed and defined in vivo has proven difficult.
2.	No structure-activity relationships are apparent among
anesthetics; a wide variety of structurally unrelated com-
pounds, ranging from steroids to elemental xenon, are capa-
ble of producing clinical anesthesia. This suggests that there
are multiple molecular mechanisms that can produce clini-
cal anesthesia.
3.	Anesthetics work at very high concentrations in comparison
to drugs, neurotransmitters, and hormones that act at spe-
cific receptors. This implies that if anesthetics act by binding
to specific receptor sites, they must bind with very low affin-
ity and probably stay bound to the receptor for very short
periods of time. Low-affinity binding is much more difficult
to observe and characterize than high-affinity binding.
Despite these difficulties, molecular, structural, and genetic
tools are now available that allow for major insights into anes-
thetic mechanisms. The aim of this chapter is to provide a concep-
tual framework for the reader to catalog current knowledge and
integrate future developments about mechanisms of anesthesia.
Five specific questions will be addressed in this chapter:
1.	What is anesthesia and how do we measure it?
2.	What are the molecular targets of anesthetics?
3.	What are the cellular neurophysiologic mechanisms of anes-
thesia (e.g., effects on synaptic function vs. effects on neuronal
excitability)?
4.	What are the most likely anesthetic molecular targets
responsible for anesthesia?
5.	What are the anatomic sites of anesthetic action in the
central nervous system (CNS)?
What Is Anesthesia?
General anesthesia can be broadly defined as a drug-induced
reversible depression of the CNS resulting in the loss of response
to and perception of all external stimuli. Unfortunately, such
a broad definition is inadequate for two reasons. First, the
definition is not actually broad enough. Anesthesia is not simply
a deafferented state; amnesia and unconsciousness are important
aspects of the anesthetic state. Second, the definition is too broad,
as all general anesthetics do not produce equal depression of all
sensory modalities. For example, barbiturates are considered to
be anesthetics but produce minimal analgesia. These conflicting
problems with the definition can be bypassed by a more practical
description of the anesthetic state as a collection of “component”
changes in behavior or perception. The components of the
anesthetic state include unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia,
immobility, and attenuation of autonomic responses to noxious
stimulation.
Regardless of which definition of anesthesia is used, rapid and
reversible drug-induced changes in behavior or perception are
essential to anesthesia. As such, anesthesia can only be defined
and measured in the intact organism. Changes in behavior such
as unconsciousness or amnesia can be intuitively understood in
higher organisms such as mammals, but become increasingly dif-
ficult to define as one descends the phylogenetic tree. Thus, while
anesthetics have effects on organisms ranging from paramecium
to man,1 it is difficult to map with certainty the effects of anes-
thetics observed in lower organisms to any of our behavioral defi-
nitions of anesthesia. This contributes to the difficulty of using
simple organisms as models to study the molecular mechanisms of
anesthesia. Similarly, any cellular or molecular effects of anesthet-
ics observed in higher organisms can be extremely difficult to link
with the constellation of behaviors that constitute the anesthetic
state. The absence of a simple and concise definition of anesthesia
has clearly been one of the stumbling blocks to elucidating the
mechanisms of anesthesia at a molecular and cellular level. Pre-
cise definitions for each of the component behaviors of the anes-
thetic state will be an important tool in dissecting the molecular
and cellular mechanisms of each of the clinically important effects
of anesthetic agents.
An additional difficulty in defining anesthesia is that our
understanding of the mechanisms of consciousness is rather
amorphous at present. One cannot easily define anesthesia when
the neurobiologic phenomena ablated by anesthesia are not well
understood. As discussed later in this chapter, the neural sub-
strates for consciousness are beginning to be unraveled2 and
new theories3,4 have incorporated this new anatomic knowledge,
leading to identification of surrogate physiologic markers of
consciousness.5
Finally, it has long been assumed that anesthesia is a state that
is achieved when an anesthetic agent reaches a specific concentra-
tion at its effect site in brain. Surprisingly, it takes a higher anes-
thetic brain concentration to induce anesthesia than to maintain
anesthesia (i.e., emergence occurs at a significantly lower concen-
tration than induction).6 This phenomenon, referred to as neural
inertia, adds a wrinkle to the definition of anesthesia, suggest-
ing that the mechanisms of anesthetic induction and emergence
may be different. This suggestion is supported by the finding that
10 Mechanisms of Anesthesia and Consciousness
the sedative component of anesthesia can be reversed by stimula-
tion of specific arousal pathways in brain, even in the presence of
“anesthetic” concentrations of inhalational agents.7,8
Inlow Os ADuestOuosoa Measured?
In order to study the pharmacology of anesthetic action, quantita-
tive measurements of anesthetic potency are essential. To this end,
Quasha and colleagues9 have defined the concept of minimum
alveolar concentration (MAC). MAC is defined as the alveolar
partial pressure of a gas at which 50% of humans do not respond
to a surgical incision. In animals, MAC is defined as the alveolar
partial pressure of a gas at which 50% of animals do not respond
to a noxious stimulus, such as tail clamp, or at which they lose
their righting reflex. The use of MAC as a measure of anesthetic
potency has two major advantages. First, it is an extremely repro-
ducible measurement that is remarkably constant over a wide
range of species.9 Second, the use of end-tidal gas concentration
provides an index of the “free” concentration of drug required
to produce anesthesia since the end-tidal gas concentration is in
equilibrium with the free concentration in plasma.
The MAC concept has several important limitations, partic-
ularly when trying to relate MAC values to anesthetic potency
observed in vitro. First, the end point in a MAC determination
is quantal: A subject is either anesthetized or unanesthetized; it
cannot be partially anesthetized. Furthermore, MAC represents
the average response of a whole population of subjects rather
than the response of a single subject. The quantal nature of the
MAC measurement makes it very difficult to compare MAC mea-
surements to concentration-response curves obtained in vitro,
where the graded response of a single preparation is measured
as a function of anesthetic concentration. The second limitation
of MAC measurements is that they can only be direcdy applied
to anesthetic gases. Parenteral anesthetics (barbiturates, neuros-
teroids, propofol) cannot be assigned a MAC value, making it
difficult to compare the potency of parenteral and volatile anes-
thetics (VAs). A MAC equivalent for parental anesthetics is the
free concentration of the drug in plasma required to prevent
response to a noxious stimulus in 50% of subjects; this value has
been estimated for several parenteral anesthetics.10 A third limi-
tation of MAC is that it is highly dependent on the anesthetic end
point used to define it. For example, if loss of response to a verbal
command is used as an anesthetic end point, the MAC values
obtained (MACawake) will be much lower than classic MAC
values based on response to a noxious stimulus. Indeed, each
behavioral component of the anesthetic state will likely have a
2 different MAC value. Despite its limitations, MAC remains the
most robust measurement and the standard for determining the
potency of VAs.
Because of the limitations of MAC, monitors that measure
some correlate of anesthetic depth have been introduced into
clinical practice.11 The most popular of these monitors converts
spontaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms into a sin-
gle value that correlates with anesthetic depth for some general
anesthetics. To date, these monitors have not been shown to be
more effective at preventing awareness during anesthesia than
simply maintaining an adequate end-tidal anesthetic concen-
tration12,13 or giving a standard dose of intravenous anesthetic.
Nonetheless, different individuals likely have different sensitivi-
ties to anesthetics and measuring a surrogate end point such as
a processed EEG value, an evoked potential,14 or a functional
neuroimaging signal indicative of integrated cortical activity may
be a better indicator of anesthetic depth than merely measuring
delivered concentration.
What Is the Chemical Nature
of Anesthetic Target Sites?
The Meyer-Overton Rule
More than 100 years ago, Meyer and Overton indepen-
dently observed that the potency of gases as anesthetics was
strongly correlated with their solubility in olive oil (Fig. 10-1,
Ok Video 10-1). Since a wide variety of structurally unrelated
compounds obey the Meyer-Overton rule, it has been reasoned
that all anesthetics are likely to act at the same molecular site.
This idea is referred to as the unitary theory of anesthesia. It has
also been argued that since solubility in a specific solvent strongly
correlates with anesthetic potency, the solvent showing the stron-
gest correlation between anesthetic solubility and potency is
likely to most closely mimic the chemical and physical properties
of the anesthetic target site in the CNS. On the basis of this rea-
soning, the anesthetic target site was assumed to be hydrophobic
in nature. Since olive oil/gas partition coefficients can be deter-
mined for gases and volatile liquids, but not for liquid anesthet-
ics, attempts have been made to correlate anesthetic potency with
solvent/water partition coefficients. To date, the octanol/water
partition coefficient best correlates with anesthetic potency. This
correlation holds for a variety of classes of anesthetics and spans a
10,000-fold range of anesthetic potencies.15 The properties of the
solvent octanol suggest that anesthetics produce their effects by
interacting with sites having both polar and nonpolar characteris-
tics. Either membrane lipids or hydrophobic domains of proteins
could satisfy these properties for a functionally relevant site for
anesthetic interactions.
Figure 10-1 The Meyer-Overton rule. There is a linear relationship
(on a log-log scale) between the oil/gas partition coefficient and the
anesthetic potency (minimum alveolar concentration, MAC) of a num-
ber of gases. The correlation between lipid solubility and MAC extends
over a 70,000-fold difference in anesthetic potency. (Reproduced with

Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
Exceptions to the Meyer-Overton Rule
While correlations of anesthetic activity with solvent solubility
(olive oil/gas or octanol/water) can explain the potency of anes-
thetic agents, there are several exceptions to these correlations.
First, halogenated ethers, barbiturates, and neurosteroids can be
either convulsants or nonanesthetics despite predictions based on
solvent solubility that they should produce anesthesia.16 Inter-
estingly, some of these polyhalogenated compounds do produce
amnesia in animals17 and are thus referred to as nonimmobiliz-
ers rather than as nonanesthetics. Second, several homologous
series of anesthetics (n-alkanes, n-alkanols, cycloalkanemetha-
nols, and perfluoroalkanes) show a cutoff effect, where long-chain
compounds cease to have anesthetic properties despite increas-
ing solubility predictive of increasing anesthetic potency.18 A final
deviation from the Meyer-Overton rule is the observation that
enantiomers of anesthetics differ in their potency as anesthetics.
Enantiomers (mirror-image compounds) are a class of stereoiso-
mers that have identical physical properties, including identical
solubility in solvents such as octanol or olive oil. Animal stud-
ies of barbiturate anesthetics, ketamine, neurosteroids, etomidate,
and isoflurane all show enantioselective differences in anesthetic
potency. These exceptions to the Meyer-Overton rule indicate
that the properties of solvents such as octanol or olive oil describe
some, but not all, of the properties of an anesthetic-binding site.
Properties such as size and shape must also be important determi-
nants of anesthetic sites of action.
Lipid versus Protein Targets
Anesthetics might interact with several possible molecular targets
to produce their effects on the Junction of ion channels and other
proteins. Anesthetics might dissolve in the lipid bilayer, causing
physicochemical changes in membrane structure that alter the
ability of embedded membrane proteins to undergo conforma-
tional changes important for their function. Alternatively, anes-
thetics could bind direcdy to proteins (e.g., an ion channel protein)
interfering with either binding of a ligand (e.g., a neurotransmit-
ter, a substrate, a second messenger molecule) or altering the
equilibrium between functionally important conformations of the
protein. The following section summarizes the arguments for and
against lipid and protein theories of anesthesia.
Lipid Theories of Anesthesia
In its simplest incarnation, the lipid theory of anesthesia pos-
tulates that anesthetics dissolve in the lipid bilayers of biologic
membranes, perturbing the bulk physical properties of the mem-
brane and producing anesthesia when they reach a critical con-
centration. While perturbations of bulk membrane properties are
produced by general anesthetics, the magnitude of the changes
produced at clinical concentrations is quite small and is unlikely
to disrupt nervous system function.19 With the increased under-
standing that biologic membranes are composed of heterogeneous
nanodomains composed of specific lipids and sterols with differ-
ing biophysical properties,20 the possible role of lipid interactions
in anesthetic action is being revisited. One provocative study
showed that anesthetics can alter membrane protein localization
to membrane nanodomains. This study examined the mechanism
of VA activation of the ion channel TREK-1. The study found that
VAs disrupt localization of the enzyme phospholipase D2 to lipid
raft nanodomains, increasing the production of phosphatidic acid
which then binds to and activates the ion channel, TREK-1.21
While this result suggests a lipid-mediated mechanism of action,
another recent study identified specific binding sites for isoflurane
on TREK-1.22 The effects of anesthetics (and other small hydro- 3
phobic molecules) on the dynamics of lipid nanodomains is an
emerging area of investigation and the interaction of anesthetics
with lipids remains a plausible contributor to anesthetic action.
Indeed, studies with model ion channels indicate that small
hydrophobic molecules can alter channel function by a combina-
tion of membrane effects and protein binding.23
Protein Theories of Anesthesia
Over the past several decades, a strong body of evidence has been
developed indicating that anesthetics can directly bind to spe-
cific hydrophobic sites on proteins and thus alter their function.
Direct interaction of anesthetic molecules with proteins satisfies j 4'
the Meyer-Overton rule and also provides the simplest explana-
tion for compounds that deviate from this rule. Anesthetic bind-
ing sites on proteins are likely to be defined by properties such
as size, shape, and localized polarity in addition to their solvent
properties. These additional properties could explain all of the
exceptions to the Meyer-Overton rule.
Relevant anesthetic target proteins are likely to be intrinsic
membrane proteins both because of their role in neuronal excit-
ability and signaling and because anesthetics are concentrated
in membranes (i.e., they have a large membraneiwater partition
coefficient). There are two likely kinds of anesthetic binding sites
on membrane proteins:
1.	Many membrane proteins have binding sites for endogenous
hydrophobic ligands, (e.g., endocannabinoids, prostaglan-
dins, steroids) through which these ligands act as either
orthosteric or allosteric modulators of protein function. Anes-
thetics could compete with endogenous ligands for binding to
such sites.
2.	Hydrophobic amino acids are the major constituents of
the a-helices that form the membrane-spanning regions of
membrane proteins and constitute the protein surface that
faces the membrane lipid. Anesthetic molecules could inter-
act with pockets formed between the a-helices or with the
hydrophobic surface of these membrane proteins, disrupt-
ing normal lipid-protein interactions, thus affecting protein
conformation and function.
Evidence for Anesthetic Binding
to Proteins
Several lines of experimental evidence indicate that anesthetics
bind to specific sites on membrane proteins. First, site-directed
mutagenesis of anesthetic-sensitive ion channels has identi-
fied amino acid residues that are crucial to anesthetic action.
While the residues identified in these studies may contribute to
anesthetic-binding sites, they may alternatively be sites that are
essential for anesthetic-induced conformational changes in the
protein. More direct approaches, including NMR spectroscopy
and photoaffinity labeling, have identified anesthetic binding
sites on ion channel proteins. Anesthetic analog photoaffinity
labeling reagents have been developed for several parenteral anes-
thetics, including etomidate,24 propofol,25,26 barbiturates,27 and
neurosteroids28,29 and used to identify putative anesthetic bind-
ing sites on the GABAa receptor, an important functional target
of anesthetics (see section on GABA-Activated Ion Channels).
The functional significance of these sites has been validated using
site-directed mutagenesis, providing strong evidence that anes-
thetics modulate ion channel function by binding to specific sites
on the channel protein. Photoaffinity labeling reagents have also
been developed for inhalational anesthetics and have identified

putative anesthetic binding sites on several ion channels, includ-
ing GABAa receptors.30
GABAa receptors are composed of five subunits arranged in a
ring with the outside facing the lipids of the plasma membrane and
the center forming an ion-conducting pore (Fig. 10-2A). There
are multiple subunit isoforms, but GABAa receptors are generally
composed of two a, two P, and one either y or 8 subunits, with each
subunit containing a transmembrane domain (TMD) composed
of four membrane-spanning a-helices (TM1-TM4), an extracellu-
lar domain that binds GABA and a cytosolic intracellular domain.
Photolabeling studies have consistently identified anesthetic
binding sites between the TMDs of adjacent subunits (intersub-
unit sites) on the outside of the pentameric ring facing membrane
lipid. Etomidate and propofol bind between TM3 (the “+” side) of
a P-subunit and TM1 (the side) of an a-subunit in the extra-
cellular half of the TMDs. Anesthetic neurosteroids bind in the
same P(+)-a(-) interface, but in the cytoplasmic half of the TMDs
(not shown). Barbiturates bind in a(+)-P(-) interfaces (where
propofol can also bind) as well as in y(+)-P(-) interfaces. Muta-
genesis of amino acids in these subunit interfaces strongly inhibits
anesthetic potentiation of GABA-elicited currents, confirming the
functional importance of these intersubunit sites. Photolabeling
studies have also identified intrasubunit binding sites for propo-
fol within the 4-TMD bundle of the P-subunit at the interface of
the extracellular domain and the TMDs25 and for neurosteroids
at corresponding sites in both the a- and P-subunits.28 Finally,
VA analog photolabeling studies have also demonstrated putative-
specific binding sites on GABAa receptors.30 The combined results
of these photoaffinity-labeling studies and associated site-directed
mutagenesis studies provide definitive evidence that anesthetics
bind to specific sites on the GABAa receptor and that these inter-
actions are mechanistically responsible for modulation of channel
function. Collectively, these data provide definitive evidence that
anesthetics bind to membrane proteins.
Although photoaffinity-labeling techniques can provide
extensive information about anesthetic-binding sites on pro-
teins, they cannot reveal the details of the three-dimensional
structure of these sites, x-ray diffraction crystallography and
cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can provide this kind of
three-dimensional detail and have been used to study anesthetic
interactions with membrane proteins. Initial crystallographic
studies examined the interactions of anesthetics with the bacte-
rial pentameric ligand-gated ion channel GLIC. GLIC is inhibited
by clinical concentrations of anesthetics and the crystal struc-
tures of GLIC complexed with either desflurane or propofol have
been solved.31 These structures reveal a preformed “intrasubunit”
binding cavity between the transmembrane a-helices within each
subunit of the ion channel. In the past few years, the cryo-EM
“resolution revolution” has enabled high-resolution structures of
heteropentameric (aPy) GABAa receptors complexed with paren-
teral anesthetics.32 These structures visualize binding of etomi-
date and propofol in intersubunit sites between the P(+) and a(-)
subunits and barbiturates between the a(+) and P(-) and the y(-+-)
and P(-) subunits (Fig. 10-2B), consistent with previous pho-
tolabeling studies. Structures of neurosteroids bound to GABAa
receptors are not yet available. However, multiple structures of
anesthetic neurosteroids bound to chimeric proteins, in which the
TMDs of a GABAa receptor a-subunit are fused with the ECD
of other pLGICs, have been solved.33-35 All of these structures
show the neurosteroid (either allopregnanolone, alphaxolone, or
pregnanolone) bound in an intersubunit site (a(+)/a(-)) on the
cytoplasmic end of the TMDs with the 3-OH group of the steroid
forming a hydrogen bond with glutamine 241 of the a-subunit.
Mutation of this glutamine to a leucine or tryptophan markedly
reduces the efficacy of neurosteroids as potentiators of GABAa
receptor currents.36
While x-ray crystallographic and cryo-EM structures provide
exquisite detail about the atomic-level interactions of anesthet-
ics with their binding sites on target proteins, they may not fully
describe how and where anesthetics act. Photolabeling studies
have identified sites for both propofol25,26 and neurosteroids28 on
GABAa receptors that are not observed in cryo-EM images, raising
the question as to whether all anesthetic binding sites are observed
in structural studies. There are several possible reasons why a
bound ligand may not be observed in an x-ray crystallographic or
cryo-EM structure. First, ion channels fluctuate between multiple
conformations (e.g., closed, open, desensitized), whereas x-ray and
cryo-EM structures are static “snapshots” of just one conformation.

208
Basic Science and Fundamentals

Each structure represents a single stable conformation of the pro-
tein, which may not be the preferred state to which a ligand binds
in the “unobserved site.” In addition, structures are obtained of
proteins either in detergent solution or in nanodiscs, which may
yield unnatural conformations37,38 or conformations to which
anesthetics do not bind. Finally, many anesthetics are very small
molecules which are challenging to resolve. The currently available
structures likely visualize anesthetic binding to the highest affinity
sites on a protein; less tightly bound anesthetics may be difficult to
visualize because the anesthetics are more mobile and thus less well
resolved. The technology of cryo-EM structural analysis of protein
structure is rapidly improving39 and better and higher-resolution
structures of anesthetics bound to GABAa receptors and other tar-
get proteins will become available in the near future. These struc-
tures should provide valuable insight into the full range of sites in
which anesthetics bind, which conformation(s) they bind to and
how they stabilize those conformations. This granular structural
information will provide the basis for virtual drug screening which
should enable identification of anesthetic agents with optimized
specificity and affinity for their target sites.
Summary
Strong evidence demonstrates that anesthetics can bind to hydro-
phobic pockets on proteins and that anesthetic-protein interac-
tions can account for the Meyer-Overton rule and deviations
from it. Photoaffinity-labeling studies demonstrate that paren-
teral anesthetics, including etomidate, propofol, barbiturates,
and neurosteroids, bind to hydrophobic pockets between the
TMDs of GABAa receptor subunits. Mutagenesis of amino acids
in these intersubunit sites dramatically reduces the anesthetic
modulation of GABA-elicited ion currents, providing unequivo-
cal evidence that anesthetics can directly alter protein function
by binding to specific protein sites. Finally, recent cryo-EM stud-
ies of heteromeric (oqP^) GABAa receptors have provided the
first three-dimensional structures of anesthetic-binding sites on
a relevant target protein. While the long-standing controversy
between lipid and protein theories of anesthesia may be behind
us, new evidence is emerging that anesthetic effects on membrane
nanodomains may also contribute to the effects of anesthetics.
There remain numerous unanswered questions about anesthetic-
protein interactions, including the following:
1. Do anesthetics compete with endogenous ligands for binding
to hydrophobic pockets on protein targets or do they bind to
fortuitous cavities in the protein?
2. Do all anesthetics bind to the same pocket on a protein
or are there multiple hydrophobic pockets for different
anesthetics?
3.	How many proteins have hydrophobic pockets in which
anesthetics can bind at clinically used concentrations?
4.	How does anesthetic binding stabilize specific conforma-
tions of a target protein?
5.	Is it feasible to develop antagonists and/or inverse ago-
nists for anesthetics that will reverse anesthesia or enhance
cognition?
How Do Anesthetics Interfere
with the Electrophysiologic
Function of the Nervous System?
The functional unit of the CNS is the neuron and ultimately
general anesthetics must disrupt the function of neurons medi-
ating behavior, consciousness, and memory NICV 10-1). In
the simplest terms, anesthetics could accomplish this by altering
the intrinsic firing rate of individual neurons, termed neuronal
excitability, and/or by altering communication between neurons,
generally occurring via synaptic transmission.
Neuronal Excitability
Neurons transmit information down their axons through action
potentials. The propensity of a neuron to generate and propa-
gate action potentials from the cell body to its nerve terminals
is called its excitability. Intrinsic neuronal excitability is chiefly
determined by three parameters: resting membrane potential,
the threshold potential for action potential generation, and the
size/propagation of the action potential. Anesthetics can hyper-
polarize (i.e., create a more negative resting membrane potential)
both spinal motor neurons and cortical neurons, and this ability
to hyperpolarize neurons correlates with anesthetic potency. In
general, the hyperpolarization produced by anesthetics is small
in magnitude and is unlikely to alter propagation of an action
potential down an axon. Small changes in resting potential may,
however, inhibit the initiation of an action potential generated
in response to synaptic excitation or in a spontaneously fir-
ing neuron. Indeed, isoflurane has been shown to hyperpolar-
ize thalamic neurons, leading to an inhibition of tonic firing of
action potentials. Anesthetics have not been shown to reliably
alter the threshold potential of a neuron for action potential gen-
eration. However, the data are conflicting on whether the size
of the action potential, once initiated, is diminished by general
anesthetics. A classic article by Larabee and Posternak demon-
strated that concentrations of ether and chloroform that com-
pletely block synaptic transmission in mammalian sympathetic
ganglia have no effect on presynaptic action potential amplitude.
Similar results have been obtained with fluorinated VAs in mam-
malian brain preparations. This dogma that the action potential
is relatively resistant to general anesthetics has been challenged
by reports that VAs at clinical concentrations produce a small
but significant reduction in the size of the action potential in
mammalian neurons. At a large synapse, amenable to direct mea-
surement of the action potential and transmitter release in the
same neuron, the slightly smaller action potential was shown
to produce a substantial reduction in transmitter release due to
the exponential relationship between the two.40 Thus, while cur- 5j
rent data still support the prevailing view that neuronal excit-
ability is only slightly affected by general anesthetics, this small
effect may nevertheless contribute significantly to the clinical
actions of VAs.
Synaptic Transmission
Synaptic transmission is widely considered to be the most likely
subcellular site of general anesthetic action. Neurotransmis-
sion across both excitatory and inhibitory synapses is markedly
altered by general anesthetics. General anesthetics inhibit excit-
atory synaptic transmission in a variety of preparations, including
sympathetic ganglia, olfactory cortex, hippocampus, and spinal
cord. However, not all excitatory synapses appear to be equally
sensitive to anesthetics; indeed, transmission across some hip-
pocampal excitatory synapses is enhanced by inhalational anes-
thetics. In a similar fashion, general anesthetics both enhance and
depress inhibitory synaptic transmission in various preparations.
In a classic study, Nicoll et al. showed that barbiturates enhanced
inhibitory synaptic transmission by prolonging the decay of the
GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic current. Enhancement of
inhibitory transmission has also been observed with many other
general anesthetics including etomidate, propofol, inhalational
10 Mechanisms of Anesthesia and Consciousness

anesthetics, and neurosteroids. As discussed below, a growing
body of genetic experiments in mice demonstrate that the poten-
tiation of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents mediates a
significant portion of the behavioral effects of each of these classes
of anesthetics.
Presynaptic Effects
Neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses has consis-
tently been found to be inhibited by clinical concentrations of VAs.
For example, a study by Perouansky and colleagues41 conducted
in mouse hippocampal slices showed that halothane inhibited
excitatory postsynaptic potentials elicited by presynaptic electri-
cal stimulation, but not those elicited by direct application of glu-
tamate. This indicates that halothane must be acting to prevent
the release of glutamate. Maclver and colleagues extended these
observations by finding that the inhibition of glutamate release
from hippocampal neurons is not due to effects at GABAergic
synapses that could indirectly decrease transmitter release from
glutamatergic neurons.42 Reduction of glutamate release by intra-
venous anesthetics has also been demonstrated, but the evidence
is more limited and the effects potentially indirect.
The data for anesthetic effects on inhibitory neurotransmitter
release is mixed. Inhibition, stimulation, and no effect on GABA
release have been observed for both volatile and intravenous anes-
thetics. In a brain synaptosomal preparation where both GABA
and glutamate release could be studied simultaneously, Westpha-
len and Hemmings43 found that glutamate and, to a lesser degree,
GABA release were inhibited by clinical concentrations of isoflu-
rane. The same group has shown that release of norepinephrine,
dopamine, and acetylcholine from synaptosomes is also inhibited
by isoflurane although less potendy compared to glutamatergic
synaptosomes. The mechanism underlying anesthetic effects on
transmitter release has not been established. The mechanism does
not appear to involve reduced neurotransmitter synthesis or stor-
age, but rather is a direct effect on neurosecretion. A variety of
evidence argues that at some synapses, a substantial portion of the
anesthetic effect is upstream of the transmitter release machin-
ery, perhaps on presynaptic sodium channels or potassium leak
channels (see later discussion). However, as discussed below,
genetic data in Caenorhabditis elegans show that mutations in the
transmitter-release machinery strongly influence VA sensitivity.44
Evidence in rodent preparations suggests that this mechanism
may be conserved in mammals.
Postsynaptic Effects
At a variety of synapses, anesthetics alter the postsynaptic
response to released neurotransmitter. Anesthetic modulation
of excitatory neurotransmitter receptor function varies depend-
ing on the receptor type, anesthetic agent, and preparation. In a
classic study, Richards and Smaje examined the effects of several
anesthetic agents on the response of olfactory cortical neurons
to application of glutamate, the major excitatory neurotrans-
mitter in the CNS. They found that while pentobarbital, diethyl
ether, methoxyflurane, and alphaxalone depressed the electrical
response to glutamate, halothane did not. In contrast, when ace-
tylcholine was applied to the same olfactory cortical preparation,
halothane and methoxyflurane enhanced the electrical response
whereas pentobarbital had no effect; only alphaxalone depressed
the electrical response to acetylcholine. Anesthetic modulation
of neuronal responses to inhibitory neurotransmitters is more
consistent. A wide variety of anesthetics, including barbiturates,
etomidate, neurosteroids, propofol, and the fluorinated VAs, have
been shown to potentiate the electrical response to exogenously
applied GABA.
Summary
VAs alter the two fundamental determinants of neuronal commu-
nication, neuronal excitability, and synaptic transmission. Both
volatile and parental anesthetics have powerful and widespread
effects on synaptic transmission that would logically contribute
to general anesthesia. Thus, the synapse is generally thought to be 6
the more relevant site of anesthetic action. Existing evidence indi-
cates that even at the synapse, anesthetics have diverse actions,
including presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release,
inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitter effect, and enhancement
of inhibitory neurotransmitter effect. Furthermore, the synaptic
effects of anesthetics differ among various anesthetic agents, neu-
rotransmitters, and neuronal preparations.
Potential Anesthetic Targets
The functions of a large number and variety of proteins are altered
by one or more general anesthetics (Table 10-1). However, dem-
onstrating that any of them is a relevant anesthetic target requires
more than the observation that anesthetics affect their function.
The anesthetic effect must occur within a concentration range 7
at which anesthesia occurs. Second, the anesthetic effect should
plausibly contribute to anesthesia; at the very least, the protein
should function in the brain or spinal cord in a way where the
perturbation of function might promote anesthesia. Third, anes-
thetics need to bind to the protein for it to be a direct anesthetic
target. Finally, genetic or pharmacologic manipulation of the
protein should alter anesthetic potency in vivo. A genetic muta-
tion that alters anesthetic binding or the effect of binding with-
out otherwise altering the function or expression of the protein
provides the most definitive experimental test of the relevance
of that binding to anesthesia. If such a mutation produces an
anesthetic-resistant animal, this is very strong evidence that this
protein is a functional anesthetic target. What follows is a review
of the evidence for the proteins that best meet these criteria as
anesthetic targets.
GABA-Activated Hon Channels
GABA is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the
mammalian CNS. GABA-activated ion channels (GABAa recep-
tors) mediate the postsynaptic response to synaptically released
GABA by selectively allowing chloride ions to enter and thereby
hyperpolarize neurons. GABAa receptors are pentameric multi-
subunit proteins consisting of various combinations of a, p, y,
8, and £ subunits with many subtypes for each of these subunits.
The function of GABAa receptors is modulated by a wide variety
of pharmacologic agents including convulsants, anticonvulsants,
sedatives, anxiolytics, and anesthetics. The following section
briefly reviews the effects of anesthetics on GABAa receptor
function.
Barbiturates, anesthetic steroids, benzodiazepines, propofol,
etomidate, and the VAs, all modulate GABAa receptor function.
These drugs produce three kinds of effects on the electrophysi-
ologic behavior of the GABAa receptor channels: potentiation,
direct gating, and inhibition. Potentiation refers to the ability of
an anesthetic to increase the current elicited by low concentra-
tions of GABA at concentrations that produce no direct effect in
the absence of GABA. Potentiation is illustrated in Figure 10-3,
showing the effects of halothane on currents elicited by a range
of GABA concentrations in dissociated cortical neurons. Anes-
thetic potentiation of GABAa currents generally occurs at con-
centrations of anesthetics within the clinical range. Direct gating

refers to the ability of anesthetics to activate GABAa channels in
the absence of GABA. In general, direct gating of GABAa cur-
rents occurs at anesthetic concentrations higher than those used
clinically, but the concentration-response curves for potentiation
and for direct gating can overlap. It is not known whether direct
gating of GABAa channels is either required for or contributes
to the effects of anesthetics on GABA-mediated inhibitory synap-
tic transmission in vivo. In the case of anesthetic steroids, strong
evidence indicates that potentiation, rather than direct gating of
GABAa currents, is required for producing anesthesia. Anesthetics

neurons. A: Clinical concentrations of halothane and enflurane potentiate GABA-elicited chloride currents. The convulsant fluorothyl antagonizes
the effects of y-aminobutyric acid (GABA). B: GABA causes a concentration-dependent activation of a chloride current. Halothane shifts the GABA
concentration-response curve to the left (increases the apparent affinity of the channel for GABA), whereas fluorothyl shifts the curve to the right
(decreases the apparent affinity of the channel for GABA). (Reproduced with permission from Wakamori M, Ikemoto Y, Akaike N. Effects of two

can also inhibit GABA-activated currents. Inhibition refers to the
ability of anesthetics to prevent GABA from initiating current
flow through GABAa channels, and has generally been observed
at high concentrations of both GABA and anesthetic. Inhibition
of GABAa channels may help to explain why VAs have, in some
cases, been observed to inhibit rather than facilitate inhibitory
synaptic transmission.
Effects of anesthetics have also been observed on the func-
tion of single GABAa channels. These studies show that barbi-
turates, propofol, and VAs do not alter the conductance (rate at
which ions traverse the open channel) of the channel; instead,
they increase the frequency with which the channel opens and/
or the average length of time that the channel remains open.
Collectively, the whole cell and single channel data are most con-
sistent with the idea that clinical concentrations of anesthetics
produce a change in the conformation of GABAa receptors that
increases the affinity of the receptor for GABA. This is consistent
with the ability of anesthetics to increase the duration of inhibi-
tory postsynaptic potentials since higher affinity binding of GABA
would slow the dissociation of GABA from postsynaptic GABAa
channels. Anesthetics would not be expected to increase the peak
amplitude of a GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic potential since
synaptically released GABA probably reaches very high concentra-
tions in the synapse.
Despite the similar effects of many anesthetics on GABAa
receptor function, different anesthetics act on distinct subtypes
of GABAa receptors. This is well illustrated for benzodiazepine
sensitivity, which requires the presence of the y2 subunit sub-
type. Sensitivity to etomidate has been shown to require the pres-
ence of a p2 or [33 subunit. The presence of a 8 or E subunit
in a GABAa receptor has been shown to confer insensitivity to
the potentiating effects of some anesthetics. Interestingly, GABAa
receptors composed of p-type subunits (referred to as GABAC
receptors') have been shown to be inhibited rather than potenti-
ated by VAs. This property has been exploited to construct chi-
meric receptors composed of part of the p-receptor coupled to
part of an a, p, or glycine receptor subunit. By screening these
chimeras for anesthetic sensitivity, regions of the a, P, and gly-
cine subunits responsible for anesthetic sensitivity have been
identified, and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis studies
were performed to identify the specific amino acids responsible
for conferring anesthetic sensitivity. These studies revealed two
critical amino acids near the extracellular regions of TMDs 2
and 3 (TM2, TM3) of the glycine and GABAa receptors that are
required for VA potentiation.45 One of the amino acids (TM3
site) has also been shown to be required (in the p2/p3 subunit)
for the potentiating effects of etomidate.46 In contrast, the TM2
and TM3 sites are not required for potentiation by propofol, bar-
biturates, or neurosteroids.47 A distinct amino acid in the TM3
region of the PL subunit of the GABAa receptor has been shown
to selectively modulate the ability of propofol to potentiate GABA
agonist effects. Neurosteroid effects on GABAa receptors require
specific sites within the transmembrane spanning regions of the
oq and P2 subunits, distinct from those for benzodiazepines and
pentobarbital.36 Collectively, these data provide strong evidence
that anesthetics act on GABAa receptors at specific sites that are
distinct for different anesthetics.
The role of the GABAa receptor in anesthesia has been
extensively studied using mouse genetic techniques. Mice car-
rying mutations in a, P, and 8 GABAa receptor subunits have
been tested for their effects on anesthetic behavioral endpoints.
a-Subunit knockout (KO) mutations (where the gene is fully
inactivated) and knockin mutations (where a functional but
altered gene product is produced) have been examined. KO of
the al and a4 subunits produced similar phenotypes with a large
reduction of the efficacy of isoflurane at blocking learning and
memory tasks.48 Similarly, an a5 KO mouse was strongly resis-
tant to the amnestic effects of etomidate.49 A knockin al mouse
strain expressing a double mutated al(S270H, L277A) sub-
unit, has also been tested for its anesthetic sensitivity.50-52 The
al(S270H) mutation had been shown to block GABA potentia-
tion by VAs,53 but the mutation also increased native sensitivity
to GABA and al(S270H) single-mutant mice are quite abnormal
behaviorally, thus confounding interpretation of the data.54 Thus,
a second mutation, L277A, was introduced into the al subunit
that compensated for the change in native gating properties.50
The al(S270H, L277A) mice are viable and behaviorally grossly
normal. These mice are mildly resistant to the hypnotic effects of
isoflurane, enflurane, and etomidate as well as the ataxic effects
of etomidate; however, the potency of the drugs in MAC and fear-
conditioning assays (a measure of learning) are not altered by the
double-mutant al subunit.

While the anesthetic behavioral phenotypes of the a-subunit
mutant mice are only incrementally different from wild-type mice,
0 subunit mutants have profound differences for the intravenous
anesthetics etomidate and propofol. Based on its insensitiv-
ity to potentiation by etomidate and propofol in electrophysi-
ologic experiments, a 03(N265M) knockin mutation mouse was
generated and tested by Rudolph and colleagues, who showed
that the strain was fully resistant to the immobilizing effects of
etomidate, propofol, and pentobarbital (Fig. 10-4).55,56 These
results provided the first definitive link in mammals between an
in vitro anesthetic action and an in vivo anesthetic behavioral end-
point. However, the 03(N265M) mice were not completely resis-
tant to the hypnotic action of these anesthetics, indicating that
other targets also contribute to their immobilization. Interestingly,
the respiratory depressant effects of etomidate and propofol are
also blocked by the 03(N265M) mutation, but the cardiovascular
and hypothermic actions of the drugs are not.57,58 The 03(N265M)
mice also have a modest reduction in sensitivity to the immobiliz-
ing actions of VAs,59 suggesting that the 03 subunit may play a
minor role in their immobilizing effect, but the mutant has unal-
tered sensitivity to the amnestic effects of isoflurane and propo-
fol.57,60 Additional evidence for the importance of the 03 subunit
comes from selective KO of 03 in mouse forebrain. In context
fear-conditioning assays (a measure of hippocampal-dependent
memory formation), 03(N265M) mice were found to be markedly
resistant to isoflurane.61 The 02 subunit has also been shown to be
important for anesthetic sensitivity. A 02(N265S) mutant mouse
has reduced sensitivity to etomidate although no anesthetic end-
point is fully blocked by this mutation (Fig. 10-4).62,63 Finally,
strains carrying a KO mutation of the 5 subunit of the GABAa
receptor have a shorter duration of neurosteroid-induced loss-of-
righting reflex, whereas their sensitivity to other intravenous and
VAs is unchanged.64 Thus, the 5 subunit may play a relatively spe-
cific role for neurosteroids.
As discussed in previous sections of this chapter, the evidence
for binding of anesthetics to GABAa receptors is substantial,
including cryo-EM evidence for binding of propofol, etomidate,
and phenobarbital to a TMD pocket implicated by the genetic

Figure 10-5 The HCN channel is inhibited by multiple anesthetics and is required in vivo for their potency. A: HCN channels are homo-
meric or heteromeric tetramers with each subunit composed of six transmembrane domains (S1-S6). The S4 domain is relatively positively charged
and is the putative voltage sensor. The ion selectivity filter lies in an extracellular loop between S5 and S6 and is selective for Na+ and K+. A cyclic
nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) lies in the C-terminal intracellular domain. (From125.) B: Halothane and ketamine inhibit the mouse HCN channel
by altering the voltage at which it is activated (V1/2) and reducing maximum current amplitude. The effects depend in part on subunit composition.
The ketamine data is for heteromeric HCN1-HCN2 channels. (From65-66.) C: A global knockout of HCN1 (HCN~/_) and a forebrain selective HCN1
knockout (HCNf/f:cre) are partially resistant to isoflurane in a loss-of-righting reflex assay compared to wild type and the HCN 1f/f without Cre control
(p < .05). (from67). D: HCN1 knockout mice (HCN1_/_) are resistant compared to the wild-type strain to the effects of ketamine in a loss-of-righting

experiments.32 Similarly, neurosteroids have been shown to bind
to a specific site between the transmembrane domains of adjacent
8 subunits.34 Thus, the GABAa receptor meets all of the criteria as
a relevant anesthetic target for propofol, etomidate, barbiturates,
and neurosteroids. For VAs, the genetic evidence is less definitive
and no structural binding data has been published. Nevertheless,
the GABAa receptor is likely a relevant but not exclusive target
for VAs.
Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic
Nucleotide-Gated Channels
9	Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN
channels) are modulated by clinical concentrations of both vol-
atile and some intravenous anesthetics. HCN channels pass a
depolarizing current (termed Ih in the CNS) consisting of a mix
of sodium and potassium ions and are activated by membrane
hyperpolarization, the voltage dependence of which is shifted to
a more depolarized range by the second messenger cyclic AMP
(Fig. 10-5A). Therefore, cAMP activates HCN channels under
most physiologic conditions. HCN channels are composed of
homomeric and heteromeric combinations of four subunits—
HCN1, 2, 3, and 4, all of which are expressed in both brain and
heart. HCN channels have been shown to regulate resting mem-
brane potential and rhythmic firing of the sinoatrial node and
spontaneously spiking neurons and thereby are important for
synchronous oscillations of neuronal networks.
VAs, propofol, and ketamine have been shown to inhibit HCN-
mediated currents in both cell culture and native mouse neurons.
The Bayliss group has shown that halothane shifts the voltage-
dependent activation of the current to more negative membrane
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
potentials and inhibits its maximal amplitude.65 Expression of
HCN1 and HCN2 homomeric channels in cultured cells showed
that halothane alters voltage dependence of activation of HCN1
channels while reducing the maximal amplitude of HCN2 currents
(Fig. 10-5B). In isolated spinal motor neurons, halothane reduces
the lh cunent, consistent with inhibition of HCN channels. Simi-
lar inhibition of HCN1 channels was subsequently observed with
clinical concentrations of propofol and ketamine. The inhibition
of HCN1 by ketamine was stereoselective in the same manner as
its stereoselectivity for general anesthesia (Fig. 10-5C).66 Nota-
bly, in this same study, etomidate was not found to inhibit HCN1
channel activation. Thus, HCN1 channels may be important for
the actions of both VAs and a subset of intravenous anesthetics.
Genetic experiments described below argue that anesthetic inhibi-
tion of HCN1 and HCN2 channels may contribute to anesthesia.
Both global and forebrain-specific KO mouse strains of
the HCN1 subunit and a global KO of the HCN2 subunit have
been generated and tested for their anesthetic sensitivity. Both
global and forebrain-specific HCN1 KO strains are mildly but
significandy resistant to isoflurane and sevoflurane in assays of
hypnosis and amnesia but similar to wild type for immobility
(Fig. 10-5C).67 The HCN1 global KO strain is strongly resistant to
ketamine (85% increased ED50) (Fig. 10-5D) and propofol (47%
increased ED50) and normally sensitive to etomidate.66 The lack of
effect of etomidate indicates that the increase is not due to some
nonspecific increase in sensitivities to all hypnotics. An HCN2
global KO strain has reduced sensitivity to the effects of xenon on
thalamic neuron currents, thalamocortical signaling, and on seda-
tion.68 Whether any anesthetic direcdy binds to HCN1 remains to
be determined.
Potassium Channels
Background or leak K* channels are activated by both volatile and
gaseous anesthetics. Background or leak channels are so named
because they tend to be open at all voltages including the resting
membrane potential of neurons, producing a “leak current.” Leak
currents can significantly regulate the excitability of neurons in
which they are expressed. Anesthetic activation of a leak channel
was first observed in a ganglion of the pond snail, Lymnea stagna-
lis.69 Clinical concentrations of halothane activated this channel
called IK(an), resulting in silencing of the spontaneous bursting of
these neurons (Fig. 10-6A). A similar anesthetic-activated back-
ground potassium channel was subsequently found by Winegar
and Yost in the marine mollusk Aplysia. The importance of VA
activation of these invertebrate potassium channels became appar-
ent with the discovery of a large family of background potassium
channels in mammals. These mammalian potassium channels
share a unique structure with two pore-forming domains in tan-
dem plus four transmembrane segments (2P/4TM; Fig. 10-6,C).
Patel et al.70 have studied the effects of VAs on several members
of the mammalian 2P/4TM family. They have shown that TREK-1
channels are activated by clinical concentrations of chloroform,
diethyl ether, halothane, and isoflurane (Fig. 10-6B). In contrast,
closely related TRAAK channels are insensitive to all the VAs, and
TASK channels are activated by halothane and isoflurane, inhib-
ited by diethyl ether, and unaffected by chloroform. These authors
further showed that the C-terminal regions of TASK and TREK-1
contain amino acids essential for anesthetic action. TREK-1 but
not TASK was found to be activated by clinical concentrations of
the gaseous anesthetics: xenon, nitrous oxide, and cyclopropane.
Thus, activation of background K+ channels in mammalian verte-
brates could be a general mechanism through which inhalational
and gaseous anesthetics regulate neuronal resting membrane
potential and thereby excitability.
The roles in anesthetic sensitivity of several background
potassium channels have been tested in limited mouse genetic
studies. A TREK-1 KO mouse was found to be significantly, but
not fully, resistant to multiple VAs for hypnotic and immobility
endpoints (Fig. 10-7).71 The VA resistance of the TREK-1 KO is

substantial, particularly for halothane where MAC was increased
by 48%. Importantly, the TREK-1 KO mice have normal sensitiv-
ity to pentobarbital, consistent with electrophysiologic data, argu-
ing against a nonspecific effect of the mutation. Westphalen et al.
used the TREK-1 KO strain to test the hypothesis that TREK-1
mediates some of the presynaptic inhibitory effects of VAs.'2
Indeed, glutamate release from synaptosomes prepared from the
TREK-1 KO strain is significantly resistant to inhibition by halo-
thane compared to release from wild-type control synaptosomes.
The role of TASK-2, another two-pore background potassium
channel, has been tested by measuring the MAC of a TASK-2 KO
mouse. Unlike the TREK-1 KO, the TASK-2 KO has MAC val-
ues similar to wild-type controls for desflurane, halothane, and
isoflurane. This result is surprising given that TASK-2 is strongly
activated by halothane and isoflurane and may be explained by
the lower level of TASK-2 expression in the nervous system com-
pared to TREK-1. KO strains for TASK-1 and TASK-3 exhibit
modest but significant resistance to VA-induced hypnosis and
immobility,73 consistent with a role for these channels in anes-
thesia. As discussed above, recent evidence argues for binding of
VAs directly to the TREK-1 protein and to nearby lipid rafts to
10	activate them.21,22 Thus, although the evidence is not as extensive
as for the GABAa receptor, TREK-1 meets each of the criteria for
a relevant VA target.
Sodium Channels
Voltage-dependent sodium channels are largely involved in gener-
ating and shaping action potentials. The effects of anesthetics on
these channels were studied by Haydon and Urban in the squid
giant axon. These studies showed that these invertebrate sodium
channels are remarkably insensitive to VAs. For example, 50%
inhibition of the peak sodium channel current required halothane
concentrations eight times those required to produce anesthesia.
Similar results have been obtained in a mammalian cell line (GH3
pituitary cells) where sodium currents were inhibited by halo-
thane only at concentrations greater than five times those required
to produce anesthesia. However, several studies with VAs have
challenged the notion that all voltage-dependent sodium channels
are insensitive to anesthetics. Rehberg and colleagues expressed
rat brain IIA sodium channels in a mammalian cell line, and
showed that clinically relevant concentrations of a variety of inha-
lational anesthetics suppressed voltage-elicited sodium currents.
Ratnakumari and Hemmings showed that sodium flux mediated
by rat brain sodium channels was significantly inhibited by clini-
cal concentrations of halothane. Shiraishi and Harris documented
the effects of isoflurane on a variety of sodium channel subtypes
and found that several but not all subtypes are sensitive to clinical
concentrations. As previously described, in a rat brainstem neu-
ron, Wu and colleagues40 found that a small inhibition of sodium
currents by isoflurane resulted in a large inhibition of synaptic
activity. Thus, sodium channel activity not only appears to be
inhibited by VAs, but this inhibition results in a significant reduc-
tion in synaptic function, at least at some mammalian synapses.
Intravenous anesthetics have also been shown to inhibit sodium
channels, but the concentrations for this effect are supraclinical.
Genetic studies of sodium channels as relevant anesthetic
targets are limited. Pal et al. examined mutant mice strains that
have reduced activity of the Navi.6 sodium channel subunit.74
Two distinct Navi.6 mouse mutant strains were tested, one with
reduced protein expression and the other with reduced activity of
the channel. Both mutants were hypersensitive to the hypnotic
effects of VAs isoflurane and sevoflurane. Interestingly, the mice
were hypersensitive to induction of anesthesia but not emer-
gence. Both of these mutants have significant baseline neurologic
disturbances; thus, the effects of the mutants on anesthetic sensi-
tivity could well be indirect, thereby confounding determination
of the role of these sodium channel subunits in anesthesia. At
present, there is no experimental evidence that anesthetics bind
to any of the sodium channel subtypes.
T-Type Calcium Channels
Voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) couple electrical
activity to specific cellular functions. Six types of calcium chan-
nels (designated L, N, P, Q, R, and T) have been identified on the
basis of electrophysiologic properties and amino acid sequence
similarities. As a general rule, VAs inhibit most VDCCs (50%
reduction in current) at concentrations two to five times those
required to produce anesthesia in humans, with less than a 20%
inhibition of calcium cunent at clinical concentrations. However,
T-type calcium channels have been found to be quite sensitive
to VAs and anesthetic neurosteroids. T-type calcium channels are
widely expressed throughout the CNS, including the dorsal root
ganglion and thalamus. These channels regulate neuronal excit-
ability, bursting behavior, and network oscillations and have been
implicated in epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Takenoshita and
Steinbach reported a T-type calcium current in dorsal root gan-
glion neurons that was inhibited by subanesthetic concentrations
of halothane. Similarly, T-type channels in the thalamus have been
found to be inhibited by VAs.75 T-type channels are also potently
inhibited by anesthetic neurosteroids.
T-type channels have three isoforms (Cav3.1, 3.2, 3.3), each of
which is inhibited by clinical concentrations of VAs.75 KO muta-
tions in the genes encoding all three isoforms have been tested
for their anesthetic sensitivity. KO of the Cav3.1 isoform does not
alter VA sensitivity for either hypnotic or immobility endpoints
in mice; however, these mice required a longer induction time
to produce hypnosis but not immobility.76 For neurosteroids,
compared to wild-type controls, a significantly smaller fraction
of Cav3.1 KO mice lost consciousness with a single dose of an
anesthetic neurosteroid.77 A mouse strain with a KO of Cav3.2
similarly exhibited a delayed VA induction phenotype, but it was
hypersensitive to immobilization by isoflurane and halothane.78
On the other hand, Cav3.3 KO mice had a shortened VA induc-
tion time and had no change in sensitivities for either hypnosis or
immobility endpoints.79 The neurosteroid resistance phenotype of
Cav3.1 is consistent with it as a relevant anesthetic target. How-
ever, for the VAs, whether the hypersensitive mutant phenotypes
and alterations in the kinetics of induction indicate that T-type
channels are volatile anesthetic targets is at this point unclear.
Clearly, none of these channels are necessary for VA sensitivity
because resistance would be observed. In addition, the mutants
have effects on baseline behavior and CNS function that confound
interpretation, and physiologic parameters such as cardiac output
and minute ventilation that would impact speed of induction were
not measured in the mutant strains. Finally, binding of anesthetics
to any of the T-type channels has not been reported. Nevertheless, 11
their high level of anesthetic sensitivity and important function in
nociception and CNS excitability make T-type channels appealing
candidates as anesthetic targets.
Shaker Potassium Channels
Voltage-gated six transmembrane potassium channels (Kv chan-
nels) open in response to membrane depolarization and repolar-
ize membranes, for example, after an action potential. Thus, Kv
channels negatively regulate neuronal action potential duration
and frequency and thereby control neuronal excitability and
neurotransmitter release. High concentrations of both VAs and
10 Mechanisms of Anesthesia and Consciousness
intravenous anesthetics are required to affect the function of most
voltage-gated K+ channels. However, members of the Shaker fam-
ily of potassium channels (Kvl.x) are sensitive to clinically rel-
evant concentrations of VAs. The Shaker family is named after
a Drosophila mutant that exhibited a leg-shaking phenotype
when anesthetized with ether as was routinely done to examine
fly strains. The shaker gene was positionally cloned and found
to encode a protein with features homologous to the previously
identified sodium channel. Subsequently, electrophysiologic
experiments with the cloned and expressed protein confirmed
that the fly Shaker gene encoded a potassium channel. Kvl.l
and Kvl.2 are the mammalian versions of the fly Shaker protein.
Sevoflurane at clinical concentrations increases current through
both Kvl.l and Kvl.2 channels.80 Conductance through the
closely related Kvl.3 channel was similarly increased by isoflu-
rane and desflurane. Kvl.l and Kvl.2 are expressed throughout
the mammalian CNS and increased conductance through these
channels by anesthetics should result in a widespread decrease in
neuronal excitability.
Genetic experiments ■with Shaker-family mutants are limited
to the flies in which the viable Shaker mutants were first iso-
lated. Drosophila strains with loss-of-function mutations in the
Shaker gene are strongly resistant to hypnosis by halothane or
isoflurane,81 providing support for their role in anesthesia in
the fly. Interestingly, subsequent experiments by the Kelz group
demonstrated that most of the anesthetic-resistant phenotype of
the Shaker mutant could be accounted for by increased emer-
gence from anesthesia and less so by reduced induction.82 Thus,
the Shaker channel may play a greater role in the transition from
the hypnotic to awake state. While no genetic evidence is avail-
able in higher organisms, microinjection of a selective Kvl.l, 1.3,
and 1.6 inhibitor into the thalamus restored the righting reflex in
animals that were exposed to hypnotic concentrations of sevoflu-
rane.80 Similarly, thalamic microinjection of an antibody against
Kvl.2 reversed sevoflurane hypnosis in a significant fraction of
12	rats.83 These data are certainly consistent with the hypothesis that
the Shaker family of channels contributes to the anesthetic state.
While there are no direct structural data visualizing anesthetic
bound to a Shaker-family channel, a photoaffinity anesthetic
ligand structurally related to sevoflurane labeled three amino acid
residues in Kvl.2 that could be competed away with sevoflurane.84
Mutation of one of these residues modestly reduced the conduc-
tance increases by sevoflurane, adding support to the hypothesis
that this residue lines a relevant sevoflurane-binding pocket.
NMDA-Subtype Glutamate-Activated
Ion Channels
Glutamate-activated ion channels have been classified into three
categories based on selective agonists: AMPA receptors, kainate
receptors, and NMDA receptors. AMPA and kainate receptors are
relatively nonselective monovalent cation channels involved in
fast excitatory synaptic transmission, whereas NMDA channels
conduct not only Na+ and K+ but also Ca^ and are involved in
long-term modulation of synaptic responses (long-term potentia-
tion). The NMDA receptor is a four-subunit heteromeric complex
composed of two obligate GluNl subunits, encoded by a single
gene, and two GluN2 subunits (GluN2A-D encoded by four
genes). GluN3 subunits can also form complexes with GluNl but
the properties of this protein are unclear and may not form func-
tional glutamate-gated channels.
NMDA-activated currents are sensitive to a subset of anes-
thetics. Electrophysiologic studies show minimal to no effects
of clinical concentrations of VAs, neurosteroids, or barbiturates
on NMDA-activated currents. On the other hand, ketamine is

a potent and stereoselective inhibitor of NMDA-activated cur-
rents. The anesthetic effects of ketamine in intact animals show
the same stereoselectivity as that observed in vitro, consistent
with the hypothesis that the NMDA receptor is a relevant molec-
ular target for ketamine. The NMDA receptors may also be an
important target for nitrous oxide and xenon. N2O85 and xenon86
are potent and selective inhibitors of NMDA-activated currents
(Fig. 10-8).
Mouse NMDA genetics experiments are hampered by the fact
that a KO mutation of the obligate GluNl subunit is lethal; mice
die shortly after birth. Similarly, GluN2B subunit KO mice have
severe behavioral abnormalities and die at birth. GluN2A, C, and
D KO mice are able to develop into adults but do have milder
behavioral and electrophysiologic phenotypes. The GluN2A
KO mouse strain has been tested for anesthetic sensitivity. The
GluN2A KO mice are partially resistant to the hypnotic effects of
ketamine87; however, they are also significandy resistant to pro-
pofol, pentobarbital, midazolam, and diazepam, drugs that have
no known effects on the electrophysiologic activity of the NMDA
receptor. Thus, an indirect effect of the GluN2A mutation on
ketamine sensitivity cannot be ruled out and is almost certainly
the case for the other drugs. Similarly, the relevance of the par-
tial resistance of the GluN2A mutants to nitrous oxide is unclear
and may be due to secondary changes in monaminergic signal-
ing in these animals. Overall, the limited mouse genetic expert- 13
ments are not sufficient to demonstrate that the NMDA receptor
is essential to the action of ketamine or nitrous oxide. However,

mutation of the essential NMDA receptor subunit in the nema-
tode C. elegans was shown to completely abolish sensitivity to
nitrous oxide while having no effect on VA sensitivity88; mutation
of a distinct glutamate receptor subunit is required for the effects
of Xenon in C. elegans.89 Thus, in the simpler nematode nervous
system, the NMDA receptor is required for the behavioral effects
of nitrous oxide.
Recently, the structures of human GluNl::GluN2A and
GluNl::GluN2B bound to the S enantiomer of ketamine, gluta-
mate, and glycine were solved by cryo-EM methods.90 S-ketamine
was found bound in a TMD pocket near the channel gate
(Fig. 10-9); this location is consistent with the electrophysiologic
effects of ketamine as a channel blocker. Mutation of amino acid
residues in the ketamine-binding pocket resulted in resistance of
the mutant receptor to ketamine inhibition in electrophysiologic
in vitro assays. In addition to demonstrating that NMDA receptors
bind ketamine, these results also suggest a means to generate via-
ble GluNl mutant mice with selective mutations that will allow
more definitive determination of the role of NMDA receptors in
ketamine anesthesia.
Mitochondrial Complex 0
The first true genetic screens for mutants with altered general
anesthetic sensitivity were performed in the nematode C. elegans
by Phil Morgan and Margaret Sedensky.91 They screened for
altered sensitivity to immobilization of C. elegans by supraclinical
concentrations of halothane. One of the isolated mutants called
fc21 was markedly hypersensitive to not only halothane but also
to isoflurane and enflurane. The fc21 mutation was subsequently
identified as a missense change in gene called gas-1, which
encodes mitochondrial NADHrubiquinone reductase, a subunit
of complex 1 of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.92 The
Morgan and Sedensky group later showed that mice with a muta-
tion in Ndufs4, another complex 1 protein, were hypersensitive
to immobilization by isoflurane, halothane, and to hypnosis by
propofol but resistant to hypnosis by ketamine.93 The finding of
ketamine resistance argues against generalized sickness or global
nervous system dysfunction accounting for the increased sensitiv-
ity to the other anesthetics. Subsequently, Morgan and Sedensky
demonstrated that mouse complex 1 function was inhibited by
clinically relevant concentrations of isoflurane and that mito-
chondria from the Ndufs4 mutant mice were hypersensitive to
isoflurane.94 Electrophysiologic recordings from hippocampal
neurons showed that the Ndufs4 mutant was hypersensitive to the
effects of isoflurane on reducing synaptic vesicle recycling during
high-frequency stimulation. Remarkably, pediatric patients with 14
mitochondrial complex 1 defects likewise have been found to be
exquisitely sensitive to VAs whereas patients with other mito-
chondrial defects are not reliably hypersensitive.95 At present, no
studies showing specific binding of anesthetics to mitochondrial
complex 1 have been reported.
Synaptic Vesicle ffleSesise ii/HscIhiiiiKSiiy
Using behavioral endpoints in C. elegans that occur at concen-
trations of VAs in the clinical range, Crowder and colleagues
screened for VA-resistant mutants and found mutations in pro-
teins regulating neurotransmitter release.44 The mutations with
the largest effect were in syntaxin 1A, a neuronal protein highly
conserved from C. elegans to humans and essential for fusion
of neurotransmitter vesicles with the presynaptic membrane.44
Although all of the mutations reduced the normal function of
syntaxin, some mutations produced hypersensitivity to VAs
while others conferred resistance. These allelic differences in
anesthetic sensitivity could not be accounted for by effects on
the process of transmitter release itself; rather, the genetic data
argued that syntaxin interacts with a protein critical for VA
action, perhaps an anesthetic target. Subsequent experiments
in Drosophila found that the expression of the same syntaxin
mutation also produced isoflurane resistance in the fly.96 Interest-
ingly, as with the shaker potassium mutants, the syntaxin mutant
primarily enhanced emergence from anesthesia in Drosophila
with less of an effect on induction.96 In mammalian models,
expression of the same mutant syntaxin in cultured rat neurons
reduces the potency of isoflurane at inhibiting neurotransmitter
release.97 A highly evolutionarily conserved presynaptic protein
called UNC-13 in C. elegans has been implicated in this syntaxin-
regulated VA mechanism.98 C. elegans unc-13 mutants are fully
resistant to the effects of clinical concentration of isoflurane, and
isoflurane prevents the normal synaptic localization of UNC-13
in C. elegans.
10 Mechanisms of Anesthesia and Consciousness
Using NMR-based methods, Nagele et al. found that isoflurane
and halothane bind to rat syntaxin in vitro at clinically relevant
concentrations and to a protein complex composed of rat syn-
taxin and two other proteins that form what is called the SNARE
complex." In all metazoans, the SNARE complex mediates
fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane and
thereby release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. The
effect of this anesthetic binding on the function of syntaxin and
the SNARE complex is unclear and may or may not relate to the
anesthetic resistance of the syntaxin mutants.
Summary
Multiple proteins are likely to be bound by anesthetics and the
function of many of these may be altered. Which of these anes-
thetic targets might actually contribute to anesthesia is the sub-
ject of the preceding section. Using the criteria as outlined above,
GABAa receptors meet all criteria as the primary relevant target
for etomidate and propofol. For VAs, the GABAa receptor and
the TR.EK-1 channel are also likely targets but are unlikely to
be the only targets. Eight other potential anesthetic targets are
discussed, each of which has strong evidence for the protein as
a probable relevant anesthetic target, but unlike for the GABAa
receptor and to a lesser degree the TREK-1 channel, for none of
these other potential targets is the evidence sufficient to declare it
a target for any particular anesthetic. A major limitation in mak-
ing a definitive assignment of a protein as a relevant mammalian
anesthetic target is the lack of genetic reagents that specifically
eliminate the anesthetic target entirely without otherwise pro-
ducing secondary neurobiologic phenotypes that confound
interpretation of the data or preclude testing entirely More facile
methods to make single point mutations in genes such as Crispr-
Cas9-based strategies combined with structural anesthetic bind-
ing data from relatively recently developed cryo-EM methods
should move some of these anesthetic targets from probable to
definite in the future.
How and Where in the
Central Nervous System Do
Anesthetics Work?
Spinal Cord—Immobility
15 Several lines of evidence indicate that the spinal cord is the main
site at which anesthetics inhibit motor responses to noxious
stimulation. This is, of course, the end point used in most mea-
surements of anesthetic potency. MAC values for fluorinated VAs
are unaffected in the rat by either decerebration or cervical spi-
nal cord transection. Isolation of the cerebral circulation of goats
demonstrated that when isoflurane is administered only to the
brain, MAC is 2.9%, whereas when it is administered to the body
and brain, MAC is 1.2%. Surprisingly, when isoflurane was pref-
erentially administered to the body and not to the brain, isoflu-
rane MAC was reduced to 0.8%, suggesting that anesthetic action
on the brain may actually sensitize the cord to noxious stimuli
through neurons in the mesencephalic locomotor region.100 Anes-
thetic action at the spinal cord underlies MAC through multiple
targets. VAs directly reduce excitatory synaptic transmission of
spinal neurons. Propofol depresses activity in ventral horn neu-
rons via a GABAergic mechanism that can be blocked by the
antagonist picrotoxin. In contrast, while isoflurane inhibits both
dorsal hom neurons and motoneurons, the mechanism appears
to be independent of GABA receptors. Isoflurane also suppresses
interneurons of central pattern generators involved in coordi-
nated movements. Thus, anesthetics can alter descending, affer-
ent, efferent, and modulatory limbs of spinal cord reflex arcs for
reacting to noxious stimulation.
Brainstem-—Autonomic Control
Anesthetics exert profound effects on cardiopulmonary and ther-
moregulatory homeostatic circuitry within autonomic centers
in the brainstem and hypothalamus. Inspiratory neurons in the
medulla drive phrenic motor neurons to activate diaphragmatic
contraction. Halothane suppresses the spontaneous activity of
these neurons in dogs by reducing glutamatergic input. Anesthet-
ics also perturb cardiovascular reflexes mediated by nuclei in the
brainstem. For example, the nucleus ambiguous contains cardiac
vagal neurons whose efferents are critical in the regulation of heart
rate by the parasympathetic nervous system. In rats, both propofol
and isoflurane augment the inhibitory potentials of cardiac vagal
neurons in response to GABA. Similarly, neurons in the nucleus
of the solitary tract receive sensory input from carotid and aortic
body baroreceptors; in vitro studies demonstrate GABA-mediated
inhibition of these neurons by propofol and isoflurane.
Mechanisms of Anesthesia—Lessons
from Sleep
Anesthetic-induced unconsciousness and sleep share putative
underlying circuits and EEG patterns; this relationship serves as
a mechanistic basis for how different classes of anesthetic agents
induce endpoints of unconsciousness and amnesia. The descent
into deep sleep and induction of anesthesia are both accompa-
nied by a shift toward lower frequencies of oscillatory EEG activ-
ity, “EEG slowing,” with the emergence of 0 band (4 to 8 Hz)
and 5 band (0.5 to 4 Hz) oscillations. In addition, occipital a
(8 to 12 Hz) oscillations commonly present during wakefulness,
known as the posterior dominant rhythm, are replaced by dif-
ferent EEG motifs. Natural sleep is classified into nonrapid eye
movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,
each with distinct EEG, electrooculographic (EOG), and elec-
tromyographic (EMG) patterns relative to wakefulness. Within
NREM, Stage N1 is a transitory state with mixed frequency EEG
activity and vertex waves. N2 is defined by the emergence of sleep
spindles—crescendo-decrescendo oscillatory motifs with fun-
damental frequencies in the 9- to 13-Hz range—and polyphasic
large amplitude motifs known as K-complexes. N3 sleep, often
described as slow wave sleep, is defined by the predominance
of slow oscillations in the 5 frequency band. The resemblance
between the EEG patterns of N2 and N3 sleep and those of states
of unconsciousness induced by dexmedetomidine, GABAergic
sedative hypnotics (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and propofol),
or VAs suggest that sleep and anesthetics engage shared neural
circuitry across cortical and subcortical structures. Dexmedeto-
midine is thought to promote biomimetic sleep, as transitions
into states with EEG resembling N2 and N3 sleep are evoked in a
dose-dependent manner.
The analogy of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness and sleep
states has limitations. REM sleep is characterized by mixed FFG
frequencies with similarities to the EEG frequency distribution
observed in wakefulness superimposed with 0 band “sawtooth
waves,” lack of EMG activity, and REMs. EEG patterns observed
in REM sleep have some similarity, but also notable differences
from, the patterns observed with ketamine, nitrous oxide, or
xenon. Within this framework, the current state of elucidating
endpoints of unconsciousness and amnesia is reviewed.

Figure 10-10 Cortical and subcortical areas implicated in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Regions implicated in anesthetic-induced
unconsciousness include member nodes of the default mode and dorsal attention networks (DMN and DAN) that span lateral and medial cortical
regions across different lobes of the brain. Fragmentation of DMN and DAN are potential mechanisms at the cortical level that disrupt awareness
during anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. The anterior insula is another cortical area where anesthetic effects could result in impaired switching
between internally directed attention (DMN) or externally directed attention (DAN). Disruptions in feedback and/or thalamocortical connectivity
may underlie altered network interactions. Anesthetics also target neurons in subcortical circuits of nuclei distributed across the basal forebrain,
thalamus, hippocampus, midbrain, and pons. These nuclei serve a critical function of regulating arousal through redundant excitatory and inhibitory
interactions such that no single area has been substantiated as a unitary mechanism underlying anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Pointed arrows
indicate excitatory pathways while flathead arrows show inhibitory projections.
Subcortical and Cortical
Structures—Unconsciousness
16 Consciousness is a complex state that can be operationally divided
into the components of arousal and awareness that may have dif-
ferential susceptibility to anesthetics.101 Awareness is the ability
to process and store information to interact with the internal or
external environment. In contrast, arousal or wakefulness is the
state of receptivity to the external environment and is likely medi-
ated through subcortical structures such as the reticular activat-
ing system (RAS) and other arousal centers. From an operational
standpoint, sedation implies easily arousable states in response to
noxious stimuli, as with sleep, with alterations in level of arousal
(drowsiness), and/or awareness (amnesia or altered perceptions
of self or the world). In contrast, the unconsciousness of general
anesthesia arises through robust impairment of both awareness
and arousal, and encompasses the inability to easily rouse an
individual despite painful stimuli. The number and distribution
of arousal centers are consistent with the redundancy of neural
structures devoted toward maintaining and stabilizing arousal
and vigilance (Fig. 10-10).
Subcortical Structures—Regulation
of Arousal and Sleep
11	The RAS is a diffuse collection of brainstem neurons that mediate
arousal, such that electrical stimulation in this structure arouses
anesthetized animals. The RAS includes the reticular formation
(RF), the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), the ventral tegmen-
tal area (VTA), and the thalamic intralaminar nucleus.
The RF is a heterogeneous collection of neurons in' the mid-
brain and pons involved in the regulation of arousal and sleep.
Lesions of the midbrain RF can induce coma while electrical
stimulation of the midbrain awakens sleeping animals. Similar
stimulation paradigms induce EEG patterns of restored arousal
in rats rendered unresponsive and anesthetized by halothane
or isoflurane. GABA levels in the pontine RF are higher during
wakefulness than in REM sleep or isoflurane-induced uncon-
sciousness. As the manipulation of GABA levels in the pontine RF
can prolong or shorten induction time, the pontine RF remains a
plausible direct target for ablation of arousal by anesthetic agents.
Spanning the hypothalamus, the TMN, and areas within the
preoptic area are putative loci for anesthetic action in suppress-
ing arousal (Fig. 10-10). The TMN and ventral lateral preoptic
nucleus (VLPO) form a bistable mutually inhibitory control cir-
cuit promoting wakefulness (TMN) or NREM sleep (VLPO).102
The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) is involved in stabilizing
sleep and maintaining sleep homeostasis.
Activation of VLPO and the MnPO appears to contribute to
sedation but not to the unconsciousness endpoint of general
anesthesia. Propofol enhances excitatory transmission to VLPO
neurons. In rodents, activation of VLPO neurons by dexmedeto-
midine induces sedation but not the loss of righting reflex103
and can antagonize the sedative effects of isoflurane.104 Ablation
10 Mechanisms of Anesthesia and Consciousness
of sleep-active VLPO neurons confers resistance to isoflurane
induction.105 In contrast, isoflurane, but not halothane, may also
activate MnPO neurons.106 Stimulation of both sleep- or wake-
promoting neurons in the VLPO and MnPO have shown that their
role in modulating sleep architecture does not extend into alter-
ing the transition between wakefulness and isoflurane-induced
unconsciousness.107
The TMN contains wake-active neurons and is the sole source
of excitatory histaminergic efferents in the CNS. Rats that have
had bilateral lesions of the TMN or been treated with intraven-
tricular injections of histamine receptor antagonists manifest both
shortened induction and prolonged emergence with isoflurane.108
Application of a GABAergic antagonist directly onto the TMN
diminished the efficacy of the anesthetics propofol and pentobar-
bital. p3(N265M) GABAa receptor mutant mice also implicate
this nucleus as a target of propofol; the inhibitory postsynaptic
potentials of their TMN neurons and the hypnotic effects of pro-
pofol are reduced. In addition to direct antagonism of the TMN,
inhibitory afferents of the VLPO suppress the locus coeruleus
(LC) and the perifomical area (PF).
The PF in the lateral hypothalamus (Fig. 10-10) appears to be
critical in anesthetic emergence rather than induction of uncon-
sciousness. It is the sole source of orexin, a neurotransmitter
that stabilizes the flip-flopping of the VLPO/TMN sleep switch
to favor activation of the arousal-promoting TMN. Orexin KO
animals show frequent sleep/wake transitions akin to narcolepsy.
In rodents anesthetized by isoflurane, intraventricular injections
of orexin-A shift the EEG from burst-suppression to arousal-like
patterns. Shortened emergence from propofol or dexmedetomi-
dine can also be induced by orexin-A injections into CSE More-
over, activation of orexin neurons expedites emergence from
isoflurane anesthesia.109 While ablation of arousal by either isoflu-
rane or sevoflurane is not affected in orexin KO animals, recovery
from anesthesia is delayed,110 suggesting asymmetry in the neural
mechanisms underlying induction and emergence.
The lateral habenula (LHb) is a glutamatergic nucleus that
connects midbrain and limbic forebrain structures (Fig. 10-10)
and regulates dopaminergic and serotoninergic tone. Blockage
of excitatory output from this nucleus antagonizes the ability
of propofol to induce sedation whereas stimulating output sup-
presses motor activity.111 Isoflurane increases activity in glutama-
tergic LHb neurons. Ablation of these neurons confers resistance
to the induction of general anesthesia.112 GABAergic neurons in
the rostral medial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) have been shown to
be an important output of the LHb. Propofol promotes excitatory
output from the LHb to the RMTg,111 while activation of RMTg
neurons confers sedation and lowers the dose of sevoflurane that
induces loss of righting reflex.113 Thus, this structure may be
important in modulating anesthetic sedation but targeting of the
RMTg is not sufficient to induce the unconsciousness of general
anesthesia.
Within the midbrain, the mesopontine tegmentum anesthetic
locus (MPTA) (Fig. 10-10) has been isolated as an important
nucleus. Microinjections of pentobarbital and propofol at this
site induced general anesthesia, suggesting a potential “switch”
for anesthetic-induced unconsciousness.114 This site is impor-
tant in regulating sleep and wakefulness, with lesions conferring
modesdy reduced sensitivities to pentobarbital, etomidate, and
propofol but with no effects on the potency of neurosteroids and
non-GABAergic anesthetics.115
The VTA provides dopaminergic inputs to the prefrontal
cortical areas, the hippocampus, and amygdala. In contrast, the
LC within the pons is the primary adrenergic source to the cor-
tex, thalamus, and hypothalamus. Dual inhibitors of these two
pathways restore righting reflex in isoflurane-anesthetized rats.8
The VTA and the dopamine DI receptor play important roles in
isoflurane, sevoflurane, and propofol anesthesia. LC activation
prolongs induction, antagonizes cortical suppression during anes-
thetic maintenance, and facilitates emergence through al adren-
ergic receptor mechanisms.116 These studies suggest that both the
VTA and LC play important roles in anesthetic unconsciousness.
Suppression of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) in the
basal forebrain is likely important in mediating anesthetic sup-
pression of arousal and awareness. The NBM receives input from
arousal centers and is the major source of excitatory cholinergic
input to the thalamus, RAS, and the cerebral cortex. Norepineph-
rine infused into the NBM induces arousal in rats with righting
reflexes ablated by desflurane. Activation of the NBM by hista-
mine reverses EEG slowing and accelerates emergence from
isoflurane but not intravenous anesthetics.117
Thalamus Cerebral Cortex-—Arousal
and Content of Consciousness
The thalamus, as a key structure that regulates widespread cortical
excitability and relays information to specialized cortical regions,
is a likely target for anesthetic ablation of arousal and aware-
ness.118 Anesthetic agents do not appear to induce thalamic deaf-
ferentation in relay nuclei for vision (lateral geniculate nucleus)
or other sensory modalities; peripheral sensory stimulation leads
to activation of corresponding cortical areas during general anes-
thesia and even during burst suppression. In contrast, neurons in
the thalamic reticular nuclei (TRN) and medial thalamic nuclei
remain plausible potential anesthetic targets. TRN neurons pro-
cess excitatory input from the cerebral cortex, dorsal thalamic
nuclei, and the RAS. They are in a key position to dampen recur-
rent loops between thalamic and cortical neurons.118 While TRN
neurons are inhibited by etomidate and isoflurane, demonstration
of their role in vivo has not been reported. Elsewhere in the thala-
mus, the stimulation or ablation of the centromedian nuclei alter
attention and arousal. Microinfusions targeting Kvl.2 potassium
channels83 or nicotinic cholinergic receptors in these regions
reverse VA hypnosis. Humans rendered unconscious by propo-
fol or sevoflurane show weakened correlation between the neural
activity in midline thalamic regions and the cortical regions
involved in attention and introspection. Optogenetic and chemo-
genetic techniques should provide a method for testing whether
anesthetics induce unconsciousness primarily at these thalamic
nuclei, or through their recurrent interactions with specific cor-
tical regions, or within the cerebral cortical regions mediating
awareness of space and time.
The cerebral cortex is the major site for generating aware-
ness of the external environment. Primary sensory areas provide
focused feed-forward activity to association and “higher” cortical
areas that provide reciprocal diffuse feedback. As such, alterations 18
in distributed cortical activity can be viewed as a final common
pathway toward anesthetic-induced unconsciousness.
The disruption of feedback connections by anesthetics may
contribute to impaired consciousness by attenuating the integra-
tion of information distributed among cortical regions. The late
components of rat visual neuron responses to flashed stimuli are
attenuated by desflurane. These high-latency responses are asso-
ciated with feedback activity and mediate contextual modulation
from higher cortical areas. Electrode recordings in rats have also
compared the directional bias of activity between frontal and pari-
etal cortical areas in both awake and anesthetized states. While
interactions are balanced during wakefulness, feedback interac-
tions were preferentially diminished when rats were anesthetized
by isoflurane. Human fMRI119 and EEG studies have yielded simi-
lar findings of reduced feedback from frontal to posterior areas,
222
Section 2
Basic Science and Fundamentals
with propofol, sevoflurane, or ketamine. At a molecular level,
attenuation of intracortical feedback could occur between layer 1
apical dendrites and in layer 5 cell bodies, via anesthetic blockade
of metabotropic glutamate and cholinergic receptors.
The effects of anesthetics on both cortical firing rates and
the timing of action potentials may contribute to the ablation of
awareness by limiting both the diversity of information that can
be represented and the integration of neural information. Concur-
rent cortical and thalamic recordings in humans anesthetized with
propofol revealed changes in correlated oscillatory activity linking
these two structures.120 Anesthetics alter the topology of distinct
networks of distributed cortical areas that subserve attention and
higher cognitive processes through patterns of correlated activ-
ity. With induction of propofol- or sevoflurane-induced uncon-
sciousness, two such networks have shown weaker correlations
among constituent cortical areas: the default mode network, asso-
ciated with memory and consciousness, and the ventral attention
network, linked with externally directed attention.121,122 These
networks represent potential cortical targets of anesthetic action.
The weakening of correlated brain activity between regions of dif-
ferent networks suggests that the blurring of boundaries between
specialized groups of cortical areas may contribute to impaired
consciousness. Alternatively, anesthetics could confer a state of
disconnected consciousness by targeting the key cortical regions
that govern the switching of attention or conscious access to
external stimuli. The anterior insula has become a candidate tar-
get, as a cortical region that governs switching between internally
and externally directed attention.123 Thus, anesthetics may induce
unconsciousness through targeting key spatially distributed corti-
cal regions (Fig. 10-10).
Hippocampus, Amygdala, and Cerebral
Cortex—Amnesia
While the neurobiologic mechanisms underlying learning and
memory remain unclear, the hippocampus is a plausible anes-
thetic target for the suppression of memory formation. Bilateral
resection of these structures induces anterograde amnesia as
demonstrated by the well-documented case of H.M. Similarly,
anesthetics ablate the formation of new memories and substan-
tially alter neural activity while leaving prior memories seemingly
intact. Genetic and pharmacologic experiments support a crucial
role for the hippocampus in the amnestic actions of anesthetics.
The a5 subtype of the GABAa receptor is primarily expressed
in the hippocampus and controls synaptic transmission within
this structure. Hippocampal GABA receptors with a5 subunits
show conductances that are exquisitely sensitivity to isoflurane
and mediate memory deficits that persist after anesthetic expo-
sure. Moreover, a5 GABAa receptor KO mice are resistant to
the amnestic effects of etomidate.19 The amnestic effects of both
volatile and intravenous anesthetics have been localized to extra-
synaptic a5 GABAa receptors. Computational modeling suggests
that augmentation of neuronal inhibition by extrasynaptic a5
GABAa receptors could lead to downstream disruption of pools
of synchronous hippocampal-cortical neuronal assemblies.12,1
Thus, extrasynaptic a5 GABAa receptors in the hippocampus are
a potential target of several anesthetic agents to induce amnesia.
Summary
Anesthetics suppress circuits in the spinal cord and brain stem
to induce immobility and disrupt autonomic homeostasis. The
hippocampus is a major site of anesthetic action for antero-
grade amnesia. As the neurobiologic underpinnings of arousal
and awareness are distributed across brainstem, subcortical,
and cortical structures, no single anatomic site is responsible for
anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Networks of subcortical
and thalamic nuclei are altered in the ablation of arousal but a sole
site that is necessary and specific for anesthetic-induced uncon-
sciousness does not appear to exist. Cortical networks critical for
cognitive processing of awareness are the tentative substrates for
the extinction of subjective percepts, both noxious and other-
wise. Network perturbations in frequency content and direction-
ality are putative mechanisms for altered integration and neural
representation.
Conclusions
In this chapter, evidence has been reviewed concerning the ana-
tomic, physiologic, and molecular loci of anesthetic action. It is
clear that all anesthetic effects cannot be localized to a specific
anatomic site in the CNS; indeed, considerable evidence supports
the conclusion that different components of the anesthetic state
are mediated by actions at disparate anatomic sites. Likewise, the
actions of anesthetics cannot be localized to a single neurophysio-
logic process. While there is consensus that anesthetics ultimately
affect synaptic function as opposed to intrinsic neuronal excit-
ability, their particular effects on pre- and postsynaptic function
vary by agent and synapse. At a molecular level, VAs show some
selectivity, but still affect the function of multiple ion channels
and synaptic proteins. The intravenous anesthetics, etomidate,
propofol, barbiturates, and neurosteroids are more specific with
the GABAa receptor as their major target. Recent high-resolution
structural studies demonstrate binding sites for etomidate, propo-
fol, and a barbiturate on GABAa receptors. Genetic data plainly
demonstrate that the unitary theory of anesthesia is not correct.
No single mechanism is responsible for the effects of all general
anesthetics, nor does a single mechanism account for all effects of
a single anesthetic. The GABAa receptor, however, does meet all
the criteria for an anesthetic target for propofol and etomidate.
Although the precise set of molecular interactions responsible
for producing anesthesia has not been fully elucidated, anesthet-
ics do act via selective effects on specific molecular targets. The
technologic revolutions in molecular biology, genetics, neuro-
physiology, structural biology, and neuroimaging make it likely
that the next decade will provide additional answers to the anes-
thetic mechanism puzzle.

Conclusion
1	Most drugs must pass through cell membranes to reach their sites of action. Consequently, drugs tend to be relatively
lipophilic, rather than hydrophilic.
2	The highly lipophilic anesthetic drugs have a rapid onset of action because they rapidly diffuse into well-perfused
brain tissue. They have a very short duration of action because of redistribution of drug from the central nervous
system to the blood.
3	The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily is the most important group of enzymes involved in drug metabolism. It and
other drug-metabolizing enzymes exhibit genetic polymorphism.
4	The kidneys eliminate hydrophilic drugs and relatively hydrophilic metabolites of lipophilic drugs. Renal elimination
of lipophilic compounds is negligible.
5	The liver is the most important organ for metabolism of drugs. Hepatic drug clearance depends on three factors:
the intrinsic ability of the liver to metabolize a drug, hepatic blood flow, and the extent of binding of the drug to
blood components.
6	The volume of distribution quantifies the extent of drug distribution. The greater the affinity of tissues for a drug
relative to blood, the greater its volume of distribution (i.e., lipophilic drugs have greater volumes of distribution).
7	Elimination clearance is the parameter that characterizes the ability of drug-eliminating tissues to irreversibly remove
drugs from the body. The efficiency of the body in clearing drugs is proportional to the elimination clearance.
8	All else being equal, an increase in the volume of distribution of a drug will increase its elimination half-life; an
increase in elimination clearance will decrease elimination half-life.
9	Most drugs bring about a pharmacologic effect by binding to a specific receptor that results in a change in cellular
function.
10	Although most pharmacologic effects can be characterized by both dose-response curves and concentration-response
curves, dose—response curves cannot be used to determine whether variations in pharmacologic response are caused
by differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or both.
11	Integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models allow temporal characterization of the relationship between
dose, plasma concentration, and pharmacologic effect.
12	In vitro drug-drug interactions due to pharmaceutical (physiochemical) properties of drugs can significantly alter
drug bioavailability and produce unintended toxic byproducts.
13	Novel approaches to antagonizing neuromuscular blockade have been developed that take advantage of in vivo
physiochemical drug-drug interactions, thereby avoiding some of the systemic side effects associated with inhibition
of plasma acetylcholinesterase.
14	Distribution clearance is influenced by changes in cardiac output and regional blood flow.
15	Inhibition of CYP isozyme activity can make it difficult to achieve adequate analgesia when using opioids such as
codeine and tramadol that require CYP 2D6 activity for conversion to the biologically active opioid.
225
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
16	Serotonin syndrome can be precipitated by a wide array of drugs with serotonergic activity, including selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and phenylpiperidine
opioids.
17	Simulations of multicompartmental pharmacokinetic models that describe intravenous anesthetics demonstrate
that for most anesthetic dosing regimens, the distribution of drug from the plasma to the inert peripheral tissues
has a greater influence on the plasma concentration profile of the drug compared to the elimination of drug from
the body.
18	Target-controlled infusions are achieved with computer-controlled infusion pumps worldwide (not yet approved by
the Food and Drug Administration in the United States), and permit clinicians to make use of the drug concentration-
effect relationship, optimally accounting for pharmacokinetics and predicting the offset of drug effect.
19	Classic pharmacokinetic models inaccurately describe the initial several minutes of drug distribution and, therefore,
overestimate interindividual pharmacodynamic variability.
20	By understanding the interactions between the opioids and the sedative-hypnotics (e.g., response surface models),
it is possible to select target concentration pairs of the two drugs that produce the desired clinical effect while
minimizing unwanted side effects associated with high concentrations of either drug.
In 1943, Halford1 labeled thiopental as “an ideal method of
euthanasia” for war surgical patients but pronounced that “open
drop ether still retains primacy!” Based on this recount of the
experience with thiopental at Pearl Harbor, it is impressive that
cooler heads prevailed; Adams and Gray2 detailed a case of a
civilian gunshot wound where they carefully titrated thiopen-
tal without any adverse respiratory or cardiovascular events. To
highlight the importance of the quiet case report versus the ani-
mated condemnation of intravenous (IV) anesthesia for patients
with hemorrhagic shock, an anonymous editorial appeared in the
same issue of Anesthesiology that attempted to give some scien-
tific justification for the discrepancy in opinions.3 As the editorial
detailed, thiopental has a small therapeutic index, and the toler-
ance to normal doses is decreased in extreme physical conditions
(e.g., blood loss, sepsis). Therefore, just like with open drop
ether, small doses of thiopental should be titrated to achieve the
desired effects and avoid side effects associated with overdose.
Fortuitously, the anesthesia community did not simply abandon
the use of thiopental, and in 1960, Price4 utilized mathemati-
cal models to describe the effects of hypovolemia on thiopental
distribution.
Anesthetic drugs are administered with the goal of rapidly
establishing and maintaining a therapeutic effect while mini-
mizing undesired side effects. Although open drop ether and
chloroform were administered using knowledge of a dose-effect
relationship, the more potent volatile agents, along with the IV
hypnotics, neuromuscular junction blocking agents, and IV opi-
oids, all require a sound knowledge of pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics in order to accurately achieve the desired phar-
macologic effect for the desired period of time without any drug
toxicity.
This chapter attempts to guide the reader through the fun-
damental knowledge of what the body does to a drug (i.e.,
pharmacokinetics) and what a drug does to the body (i.e., phar-
macodynamics). The initial section of this chapter discusses the
biologic and pharmacologic factors that influence the absorption,
distribution, and elimination of a drug from the body. Where nec-
essary, quantitative analyses of these processes are discussed to
give readers insight into the intricacies of pharmacokinetics that
cannot be easily described by text alone. The second section con-
centrates on the factors that determine the relationship between
drug concentration and pharmacologic effect. Once again, math-
ematical models are presented as needed in order to clarify phar-
macodynamic concepts. The third section applies concepts from
the first two sections in order to describe the clinically important
drug-drug interactions that are encountered in the perioperative
period. The final section builds on the reader’s knowledge gained
from the first two sections to apply the principles of pharmacoki-
netics and pharmacodynamics to determine the target concentra-
tion of IV anesthetics required and the dosing strategies necessary
to produce an adequate anesthetic state. Understanding these
concepts should allow the reader to integrate the anesthetic drugs
of the future into a rational anesthetic regimen. Although specific
drugs are utilized to illustrate pharmacokinetic and pharmaco-
dynamic principles throughout this chapter, the principles dis-
cussed are universal. Detailed pharmacologic information of the
anesthetic pharmacopeia are presented in subsequent chapters of
this book.
Pharmacokinetic Principles
Drug Absorption and
of Administration
Transfer of Drugs across Membranes
Even drugs that are administered directly into the bloodstream 1
must move across at least one cell membrane to get to their site
of action. Because biologic membranes are lipid bilayers com-
posed of a lipophilic core sandwiched between two hydrophilic
layers, only small lipophilic drugs can passively diffuse across the
membrane down their concentration gradients. For water-soluble
drugs to passively diffuse across the cell membrane down a con-
centration gradient, a hydrophilic channel formed from trans-
membrane proteins is required. Nonspecific hydrophilic channels
are abundant in the capillary endothelium of all organs except for
the central nervous system (CNS). As a result, passive transport of
drugs from the intravascular space into the interstitium of vari-
ous organs is limited by blood flow, not by the lipid solubility of
the drug.5
In the CNS, the blood-brain barrier capillary endothelial cells
have very limited numbers of transmembrane hydrophilic chan-
nels. Hydrophilic drugs can only enter the CNS after binding
to drug-specific transmembrane proteins that actively transport
the hydrophilic drug across the capillary endothelium into the
CNS interstitium. When these transmembrane carrier proteins
require energy to transport the drug across the membrane, they
are able to shuttle compounds against their concentration gra-
dients, a process called active transport. In contrast, when these
carrier proteins do not require energy to shuttle drugs, they can-
not overcome concentration gradients, a process called facilitated
diffusion. Active transport is not limited to the CNS; it is also
found in the organs related to drug elimination (e.g., hepatocytes,
renal tubular cells, pulmonary capillary endothelium), where the
11 Basic Principles of Clinical Pharmacology
ability to transport drugs against the concentration gradient has
specific biologic advantages. Both active transport and facilitated
diffusion of drugs are saturable processes that are primarily lim-
ited by the number of carrier proteins available to shuttle a spe-
cific drug.5
For lipophilic compounds, transporters are not needed for the
drug to diffuse across the capillary wall into tissues, but the pres-
ence of transporters does affect the concentration gradients that
exist. For instance, some lipophilic drugs are transported out of
tissues by adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent transport-
ers such as p-glycoprotein (P-gp). The lipophilic potent |l-opioid
agonist, loperamide, used for the treatment of diarrhea, has lim-
ited bioavailability because of P-gp transporters at the intestine-
portal capillary interface. What does reach the circulation has
its CNS penetrance limited by P-gp at the blood-brain barrier.6
Conversely, lipophilic compounds can be transported into tis-
sues, increasing the tissue concentration of the drug beyond what
would be accomplished by passive diffusion. The class of trans-
porters called organic anion polypeptide transporters (OATPs) is
located in the microvascular endothelium of the brain and trans-
ports endogenous opioids into the brain.7,8 These OATPs also
transport drugs. The degree to which transporter proteins may
account for intra- and interindividual responses to anesthetic
drugs has not been well-studied to date.9
Intravenous Administration
In order for a drug to be delivered to the site of drug action, it
must be absorbed into the systemic circulation. Therefore, IV
administration results in immediate delivery of a drug with 100%
bioavailability. This can lead to rapid overshoot of the desired
plasma concentration which can potentially result in immediate
and severe side effects for drugs that have a low therapeutic index
(defined as the ratio of the blood concentration that produces
a toxic effect in 50% of the population to the blood concentra-
tion that produces a therapeutic effect in 50% of the population).
Except for IV administration, the absorption of a drug into the
systemic circulation is an important determinant of the time
course of drug action and the maximum drug effect produced.
As the absorption of drug is slowed, the maximum plasma con-
centration achieved—and therefore the maximum drug effect
achieved—is limited. However, as long as the plasma concentra-
tion is maintained at a level above the minimum effective plasma
concentration, the drug will produce a drug effect.10 Therefore,
non-IV methods of drug administration can produce a sustained
and significant drug effect that may be more advantageous than
IV administration.11
Bioavailability is the relative amount of a drug dose that reaches
the systemic circulation unchanged and the rate at which this
occurs. For most intravenously administered drugs, the absolute
bioavailability is close to unity and the rate is nearly instanta-
neous. However, the pulmonary endothelium can slow the rate
at which intravenously administered drugs reach the systemic cir-
culation if distribution into the alveolar endothelium is extensive,
such as it is with fentanyl. The pulmonary endothelium also con-
tains enzymes that may metabolize intravenously administered
drugs (e.g., propofol) on first pass.12
Oral Administration
For almost all therapeutic agents, oral administration is the saf-
est and most convenient method of administration. However,
this route is not utilized significandy in anesthesia practice
because of the limited and inconstant rate of bioavailability.
The absorption rate in the gastrointestinal tract is highly vari-
able because the main determinant of the timing of absorption is
gastric emptying into the small intestines, where the surface area
for absorption is several orders of magnitude greater than that of
the stomach or large intestines. In addition, the active metabo-
lism of drug by the small intestine mucosal epithelium, and the
obligatory path through the portal circulation before entering
the systemic circulation, contribute to decreased bioavailability
of drugs administered via the oral route.13 In fact, the metabolic
capacity of the liver for drugs is so high that only a small fraction
of most orally administered lipophilic drugs actually reach the
systemic circulation. Because of this extensive first-pass metabo-
lism, the oral dose of most drugs must be significantly higher
than the IV dose to generate a therapeutic plasma concentration.
In addition, time until peak concentration is prolonged and vari-
able, making the oral route impractical to utilize in the periop-
erative setting.
Highly lipophilic drugs that can maintain a high contact time
with nasal or oral (sublingual) mucosa can be absorbed without
needing to traverse the gastrointestinal tract. Sublingual admin-
istration of drug has the additional advantage that absorbed drug
directiy enters the systemic venous circulation and therefore is
able to bypass the metabolically active intestinal mucosa and
hepatic first-pass metabolism. Therefore, small doses of drug
can rapidly achieve high plasma concentration and therapeutic
effect.14 However, because of formulation limitations and the
small surface area available for absorption, there are only a limited
number of drugs that are available for sublingual administration
(e.g., nitroglycerin, fentanyl).
Transcutaneous Administration
A few lipophilic drugs have been manufactured in formulations
that are sufficient to allow penetration of intact skin. Although
scopolamine, nitroglycerin, opioids, and clonidine all produce
therapeutic systemic plasma concentrations when administered
as “drug patches,” the extended amount of time that it takes to
achieve an effective therapeutic concentration limits practical
application except in the context of maintenance therapy. The use
of electric current to increase the speed of passive drug diffusion
has been described for fentanyl but is still limited in practicality.15
Intramuscular and Subcutaneous Administration
Absorption of drugs from depots in subcutaneous or muscle tis-
sue is directly dependent on the drug formulation and the blood
flow to the depot. Blood flow to muscles is high in most physi-
ologic states. Therefore, intramuscular drug absorption is rela-
tively rapid and complete. As a result, some aqueous drugs can
be administered as intramuscular injection with rapid and pre-
dictable effects (e.g., neuromuscular junction blocking agents).
Drug absorption following subcutaneous administration is more
unpredictable because of the variability of subcutaneous blood
flow, especially in the context of certain disease pathologies; this
is the primary reason that subcutaneous heparin and regular insu-
lin administered perioperatively have variable times of onset and
maximum effect.
Intrathecal, Epidural, and Perineural Injection
Because the spinal cord is the primary site of action of many anes-
thetic agents, direct injection of local anesthetics and opioids into
the intrathecal space bypasses the limitations of drug absorption
and drug distribution by any other route of administration. This
is not the case for epidural and perineural administration of local
anesthetics, because such administration still requires that drug
be absorbed through the dura or nerve sheath in order to reach its
site of action. The major downside to these routes of administra-
tion is the relative expertise required to perform them.
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
Inhalational Administration
Owing to the large surface area afforded by pulmonary alveoli and
high volume of blood flow in the pulmonary capillaries, adminis-
tration of drugs by inhalation is extremely desirable.16 New tech-
nologies have been developed which can rapidly and predictably
aerosolize a wide range of drugs and thus achieve pharmacoki-
netic effects comparable to IV administration.17,18 These devices
are currently in Phase II Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
trials.
Drug Distribution
Once drug has entered the systemic circulation, it is transported
through the circulation to all of the organs of the body. The rela-
tive distribution of cardiac output among organ vascular beds
determines the speed at which organs are exposed to drug. The
highly perfused core circulatory components—brain, lungs,
heart, and kidneys—receive the highest relative distribution of
cardiac output and therefore are the first organs to reach equi-
librium with plasma drug concentrations.4 Drug concentrations
then equilibrate with the less well-perfused muscles and liver and
then, finally, with the relatively poorly perfused splanchnic vascu-
lature, adipose tissue, and bone.
Whether by passive diffusion or transporter mediation, drug
transport at the capillaries is not usually saturable, so the amount
of drug uptake by tissues and organs is limited by the blood flow
they receive (i.e., flow-limited drug uptake).
Although the rate of initial drug delivery may be dependent
on the relative blood flow to the organ, the rate of drug equilibra-
tion by the tissue is dependent on the ratio of blood flow to tissue
content. Therefore, drug uptake rapidly approaches equilibrium
in the highly perfused, but low-volume brain, kidneys, and lungs
in minutes, whereas drug transfer to the less well-perfused,
intermediate-volume muscle tissue may take hours to approach
equilibrium, and drug transfer to the poorly perfused, large cel-
lular volumes of adipose tissue does not equilibrate for days.11
Redistribution
2; Highly lipophilic drugs such as thiopental and propofol rap-
idly diffuse into the well-perfused brain tissue usually within
a minute after IV injection. Because of the low tissue volume
but high perfusion of the brain, the drug concentration in the
cerebral arterial blood rapidly equilibrates with the concentra-
tion in the brain tissue (usually within 3 minutes). As drug con-
tinues to be taken up by other tissues with lower blood flows
and higher tissue mass, the plasma concentration of the drug
rapidly decreases. Once the dntg concentration in the brain tis-
sue is higher than the plasma concentration of drug, there is a
reversal of the drug concentration gradient so that the lipophilic
drug readily diffuses back into the blood and is redistributed to
the other tissues that are still taking up drug.4,19,20 This pro-
cess continues for each of the organ beds; ultimately, the adi-
pose tissue contains the majority of the lipophilic drug that has
not been removed from the body by metabolism or excretion.
However, after a single bolus of a highly lipophilic drug, the
brain’s tissue concentration rapidly decreases below therapeu-
tic levels due to redistribution of drug to muscle tissue, which
has a greater relative perfusion compared to adipose tissue.4,20
Although single, moderate doses of highly lipophilic drugs have
a very short CNS duration of action because of redistribution
of drug from the CNS to the blood and less well-perfused tis-
sues, repeated injections of a drug allow the rapid establishment
of significant peripheral tissue concentrations. When the tissue
concentrations of a drug are high enough, the decrease in plasma
drug concentration below therapeutic threshold becomes solely
dependent on drug elimination.21
Drug Elimination
Besides being excreted unchanged from the body, a drug can be
biotransformed (metabolized) into one or more new compounds
that are then eliminated from the body. Either mechanism of
elimination will decrease the drug concentration such that the
concentration will eventually be negligible and therefore unable
to produce a drug effect. Elimination is the pharmacokinetic
term that describes all the processes that remove a drug from the
body. Although the liver and the kidneys are considered the major
organs of drug elimination, drug metabolism can occur at many
other locations that contain active drug-metabolizing enzymes
(e.g., pulmonary vasculature, red blood cells), and drug can be
excreted unchanged from other organs (e.g., lungs).
Elimination clearance (drug clearance) is the theoretical
volume of blood from which drug is completely and irreversibly
removed in a unit of time.22 Total drug clearance can be calcu-
lated with pharmacokinetic models of blood concentration versus
time data.
Biotransformation Reactions
Most drugs that are excreted unchanged from the body are hydro-
philic and therefore readily pass into urine or stool. Drugs that are
not sufficiently hydrophilic to be able to be excreted unchanged
require modification into more hydrophilic, excretable com-
pounds. Enzymatic reactions that metabolize drugs can be classi-
fied into Phase I and Phase II biotransformation reactions. Phase I
reactions tend to transform a drug into one or more polar, and
hence potentially excretable compounds. Phase II reactions trans-
form the original drug by conjugating a variety of endogenous
compounds to a polar functional group of the drug, making the
drug more hydrophilic. Often drugs will undergo a Phase I reac-
tion to produce a new compound with a polar functional group
that will then undergo a Phase II reaction, making the new metab-
olite even more hydrophilic. However, it is possible for a drug to
undergo either a Phase I or Phase II reaction alone.
Phase I Reactions
Phase I reactions may hydrolyze, oxidize, or reduce the parent
compound. Hydrolysis is the insertion of a molecule of water into
another molecule, which forms an unstable intermediate com-
pound that subsequently splits apart. Thus, hydrolysis cleaves the
original substance into two separate molecules. Hydrolytic reactions
are the primary way amides (such as lidocaine and other amide local
anesthetics) and esters (such as succinylcholine) are metabolized.
Many drugs are biotransformed by oxidative reactions.
Oxidations are defined as reactions that remove electrons from a
molecule. The common element of most, if not all, oxidations
is an enzymatically mediated reaction that inserts a hydroxyl
group (OH) into the drug molecule. In some instances, this pro-
duces a chemically stable, more polar hydroxylated metabolite.
However, hydroxylation usually creates unstable compounds that
spontaneously split into separate molecules. Many different bio-
transformations are affected by this basic mechanism. Dealkylation
(removal of a carbon-containing group), deamination (removal of
nitrogen-containing groups), oxidation of nitrogen-containing
groups, desulfuration, dehalogenation, and dehydrogenation, all
follow an initial hydroxylation. Hydrolysis and hydroxylation are
comparable processes. Both have an initial, enzymatically medi-
ated step that produces an unstable compound that rapidly dis-
sociates into separate molecules.
11 Basic Principles of Clinical Pharmacology
Some drugs are metabolized by reductive reactions, that is, reac-
tions that add electrons to a molecule. In contrast to oxidations,
where electrons are transferred from NADPH to an oxygen atom,
the electrons are transferred to the drug molecule. Oxidation of
xenobiotics requires oxygen, but reductive biotransformation is
inhibited by oxygen; there, these reactions are facilitated when
intracellular oxygen tension is low.
Cytochrome P450 Enzymes
3 The cytochrome P450 (CYP) is the superfamily of constitutive
and inducible enzymes that catalyze most Phase I biotransforma-
tions. CYP3A4 is the single most important enzyme, accounting
for 40% to 45% of all CYP-mediated drug metabolism. CYPs are
incorporated into the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of hepato-
cytes and the membranes of the upper intestinal enterocytes in
high concentrations. CYPs are also found in the lungs, kidneys,
and skin, but in much smaller numbers. CYP isoenzymes oxidize
their substrates primarily by the insertion of an atom of oxygen
in the form of a hydroxyl group, while another oxygen atom is
reduced to water.
Several constitutive CYPs are involved in the production of
endogenous compounds, such as cholesterol, steroid hormones,
prostaglandins, and eicosanoids. In addition to the constitu-
tive forms, production of CYPs can be induced by a variety of
xenobiotics. CYP drug-metabolizing activity increases after expo-
sure to various exogenous chemicals, including many drugs.
The number and type of CYPs present at any time depends on
exposure to different xenobiotics. The CYP system is able to
protect the organism from the deleterious effects of accumula-
tion of exogenous compounds because of its two fundamental
characteristics—broad substrate specificity and the capability to
adapt to exposure to different substances by induction of different
CYP isoenzymes. Table 11-1 groups drugs encountered in anes-
thetic practice according to the CYP isoenzymes responsible for
their biotransformation.
Biotransformations can be inhibited if different substrates
compete for the drug-binding site on the same CYP member. The
effect of two competing substrates on each other’s metabolism
depends on their relative affinities for the enzyme. Biotransfor-
mation of the compound with the lower affinity is inhibited to a
greater degree. This is the mechanism by which the histamine-2
(H2) receptor antagonist cimetidine inhibits the metabolism of
many drugs, including meperidine, propranolol, and diazepam.
The newer H2 antagonist ranitidine has a different structure
and causes fewer clinically significant drug interactions. Other
drugs, notably calcium channel blockers and antidepressants,
also inhibit oxidative drug metabolism in humans. This informa-
tion allows clinicians to predict which combinations of drugs are
more likely to lead to clinically significant interactions because of
altered drug metabolism.
Phase II Reactions
Phase II reactions are also known as conjugation or synthetic reac-
tions. Many drugs do not have a polar chemical group suitable for
conjugation, so conjugation occurs only after a Phase 1 reaction.
Other drugs, such as morphine, already have a polar group that
serves as a “handle” for conjugation, and they undergo these reac-
tions directly Various endogenous compounds can be attached
to parent drugs or their Phase I metabolites to form conjugation
products. These endogenous substrates include glucuronic acid,
acetate, and amino acids. Mercapturic acid conjugates result from
the binding of exogenous compounds to glutathione. Other con-
jugation reactions produce sulfated or methylated derivatives of
drugs or their metabolites. Like the CYP system, the enzymes

that catalyze Phase II reactions are inducible. Phase II reactions
produce conjugates that are polar, water-soluble compounds.
This facilitates the ultimate excretion of the drug via the kid-
neys or hepatobiliary secretion. Like CYP, there are different
families and superfamilies of the enzymes that catalyze Phase II
biotransformations.
Genetic Variations in Drug Metabolism
For most enzymes involved in Phase I and Phase II reactions,
there are several biologically available isoforms. Drug metab-
olism varies among individuals because of variability in the
genes controlling the numerous enzymes responsible for bio-
transformation. For most drugs, the population distribution of
the rates of metabolism is unimodal. If there are genetic vari-
ants (polymorphisms) that affect the rate of drug metabolism,
the population distribution of the rates of metabolism will be
multimodal. More detailed analysis of this multimodal distribu-
tion will reveal subpopulations that have different rates of drug
elimination, and the rates of drug metabolism in each of these
subpopulations will be in a unimodal distribution. For exam-
ple, different genotypes result in either normal, low, or (rarely)
absent plasma pseudocholinesterase activity, accounting for the
well-known differences in responses to succinylcholine. Many
drug-metabolizing enzymes exhibit genetic polymorphism,
including CYP and various transferases that catalyze phase II
reactions.
Chronologic Variations in Drug Metabolism
The activity and capacity of the CYP enzymes increase from
subnormal levels in the fetal and neonatal periods to normal
230	Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
levels by about 1 year of age. Although age is a covariate in
mathematical models of drug elimination, it is not clear if
these changes are related to chronologic changes in organ
function (age-related organ dysfunction) or to a decrease in
CYP levels with age. In contrast, although the neonate has a
limited ability to perform phase II conjugation reactions, after
1 year, advanced age does not affect the capacity to perform
phase II reactions.
Renal Drug Clearance
4; The primary role of the kidneys in drug elimination is to
excrete into urine the unchanged, hydrophilic drugs, and the
hepatically derived metabolites from Phase I and Phase II reac-
tions of lipophilic drugs. The elimination of drugs by passive
glomerular filtration is a very inefficient process—any signifi-
cant degree of protein binding of the drug will decrease the
renal drug clearance below the glomerular filtration rate. In
order to make renal elimination more efficient, the proximal
renal tubular cells contain active transporters for both organic
acids and bases. Although these transporters are saturable, they
allow for the rate of renal drug clearance to approach the renal
blood flow.
In reality, renal drug clearance of actively secreted drugs
can be inhibited by both passive tubular reabsorption of lipo-
philic drugs and active, carrier-mediated tubular reabsorption
of hydrophilic drugs. Therefore, the small amount of filtered
and secreted lipophilic drug is easily reabsorbed in the distal
tubules, making the net renal clearance negligible. In contrast,
the large amount of filtered and secreted hydrophilic drug can
be passively reabsorbed if renal tubular flow decreases substan-
tially (e.g., oliguria) and/or the urine pH favors the unionized
form of the hydrophilic drug. Renal drug clearance, even for
drugs eliminated primarily by tubular secretion, is dependent
on renal function. Therefore, in patients with acute and chronic
causes of decreased renal function, including age, low cardiac
output states, and hepatorenal syndrome, drug dosing must be
altered in order to avoid accumulation of parent compounds
and potentially toxic metabolites (e.g., lidocaine, meperidine)
(Table 11-2).
drug delivered to the liver is available for elimination and that
the elimination is a first-order process—a constant fraction of the
available drug is eliminated per unit time. The fraction of the drug
removed from the blood passing through the liver is the hepatic
extraction ratio, E:
(11-1)
where Ca is the mixed hepatic arterial-portal venous drug concen-
tration and Cv is the mixed hepatic venous drug concentration.
The total hepatic drug clearance, ClH, is:
ClH = QE (11-2)
where Q is hepatic blood flow. Therefore, hepatic clearance is
a function of hepatic blood flow and the ability of the liver to
extract drug from the blood.
The ability to extract drug depends on the activity of drug-
metabolizing enzymes and the capacity for hepatobiliary
excretion—the intrinsic clearance of the liver (Clj).
Intrinsic clearance represents the ability of the liver to remove
drug from the blood in the absence of any limitations imposed by
blood flow or drug binding. The relationship of total hepatic drug
clearance to the extraction ratio and intrinsic clearance, Cl,, is:
ClH=Q-E = Q
Cl,-
Q+Cl,-
(11-3)
The right-hand side of Equation 11-3 indicates that if intrin-
sic clearance is very high (many times larger than hepatic blood
flow, Clj WQ), total hepatic clearance approaches hepatic blood
flow. On the other hand, if intrinsic clearance is very small
(Q + Clj ~ Q), hepatic clearance will be nearly equivalent to
intrinsic clearance.
Thus, hepatic drug clearance and extraction are determined
by two independent variables, intrinsic clearance and hepatic
blood flow. Changes in either will change hepatic clearance. How-
ever, the extent of the change depends on the initial relationship
between intrinsic clearance and hepatic blood flow, according to
the nonlinear relationship:
Hepatic Drug Clearance
5 Drug elimination by the liver depends on the intrinsic ability of
the liver to metabolize the drug (intrinsic clearance, Cl,), and the
amount of drug available to diffuse into the fiver. Many types of
mathematical models have been developed to attempt to accu-
rately describe the relationships among hepatic artery blood flow,
portal artery blood flow, intrinsic clearance, and drug binding to
plasma proteins.23,24 According to these models, the unbound
concentration of drug in the hepatic venous blood (Cv) is in equi-
librium with the drug within the liver that is available for elimi-
nation. These models also make the assumption that all of the

(11-4)
If the initial intrinsic clearance is small relative to hepatic blood
flow, then the extraction ratio is also small, and Equation 11-5
reduces to the following relationship:
E = — 1 (ll-5a)
Q
Equation ll-5a indicates that doubling intrinsic clearance
will produce an almost proportional increment in the extraction
ratio, and, consequently, hepatic elimination clearance (Fig. 11-1,
inset). However, if intrinsic clearance is much greater than hepatic
blood flow, Equation 11-4 reduces to the following relationship:
Cl,
Ci,
» 1
(ll-5b)
Equation ll-5b demonstrates that the extraction ratio is inde-
pendent of intrinsic clearance and therefore, a change in intrin-
sic clearance has a negligible effect on the extraction ratio and
hepatic drug clearance (Fig. 11-1). In nonmathematical terms,
high intrinsic clearance indicates efficient hepatic elimination. It
is hard to enhance an already efficient process, whereas it is rela-
tively easy to improve on inefficient drug clearance because of low
intrinsic clearance.

For drugs with a high extraction ratio and a high intrinsic
clearance, hepatic elimination clearance is directly proportional
to hepatic blood flow. Therefore, any manipulation of hepatic
blood flow will be directly reflected by a proportionate change in
hepatic elimination clearance (Fig. 11-2). In contrast, when the
intrinsic clearance is low, changes in hepatic blood flow produce
inversely proportional changes in extraction ratio (Fig. 11-3);
therefore, the hepatic elimination clearance is essentially inde-
pendent of hepatic blood flow and exquisitely related to intrinsic
clearance. Classifying drugs as having either low, intermediate, or
high extraction ratios (Table 11-3) allows predictions to be made
on how intrinsic hepatic clearance and hepatic blood flow affect
Figure 11-2 The relationship between liver blood flow (Q, x-axis)
and hepatic clearance (€/„, y-axis) for different values of intrinsic clear-
ance (C/,). When the intrinsic clearance is low, hepatic elimination clear-
ance is independent of liver blood flow—the drug elimination is limited
by the capacity of the liver to metabolize the drug (i.e., the intrinsic
clearance). In contrast, as intrinsic clearance increases, the hepatic
elimination becomes more dependent on hepatic blood flow—the liver
is able to metabolize all of the drug that it is exposed to and therefore
only limited by the amount of drug that is delivered to the liver (i.e.,
flow limited metabolism).
hepatic elimination clearance. This allows gross adjustments to
be made in hepatically metabolized drug dosing to avoid excess
accumulation of drugs (decreased hepatic elimination without
dose adjustment) or subtherapeutic dosing strategies (increased
hepatic elimination without dose adjustment).
Pharmacologic and pathologic manipulations of cardiac output,
with its consequences on hepatic/splanchnic blood flow and renal
blood flow, are important covariates when designing drug-dosing
strategies.25 As detailed above, in states where cardiac output is
decreased (e.g., heart failure, shock, spinal anesthesia), high-
extraction ratio drugs will have a decrease in hepatic elimination,
whereas low-extraction rate drugs will have minimal change in
clearance.26,27 Autoregulation of renal blood flow maintains a rel-
atively constant renal elimination clearance across a wide range
of cardiac outputs until low urine output states eventually allow
increased reabsorption of drugs from the distal tubules.28

and hepatic extraction ratio (E, y-axis) for different values of intrinsic

blood flows cause a decrease in the extraction ratio because the liver
has limited metabolic capabilities. In contrast, when the intrinsic clear-
ance is high, the extraction ratio is essentially independent of hepatic
blood flow because the liver's ability to eliminate drug is well above the
amount of drug provided by normal hepatic blood flow.

Pharmacokinetic Models
The concentration of drug at its site or sites of action is the
fundamental determinant of a drug’s pharmacologic effects.
Although the blood is rarely the site of action for a drug, the
tissue drug concentration in any given organ is a function of the
blood flow to that organ, the concentration of drug in the arterial
inflow to the organ, the capacity of the organ to take up the drug,
and the degree to which the drug diffuses between the blood and
the organ.
Physiologic versus Compartment Models
Initial pharmacokinetic models of IV and inhalational anesthet-
ics used physiologic or perfusion models.4 In these models, body
tissues are lumped into groups that have similar distribution of
cardiac output and capacity for drug uptake. Highly perfused
tissues with a large amount of blood flow per volume of tissue
are classified as the vessel-rich group, whereas tissues with a
balanced amount of blood flow per volume of tissue are classi-
fied as the lean tissue group or fast tissue group. The vessel-poor
group (slow tissue group) is comprised of tissues that have a large
capacity for drug uptake but a limited tissue perfusion. Although
identification of the exact organs that make up each tissue group
is not possible from the mathematical model, it is apparent that
the highly perfused tissues are composed of the brain, lungs,
kidneys, and a subset of muscle; the fast equilibrating tissue are
likely to be the majority of muscle and some of the splanchnic
bed (e.g., liver); and the slowly equilibrating tissues contain the
majority of the adipose tissue and the remainder of the splanch-
nic organs.
Based on these computationally and experimentally intense
physiologic models, Price4,19 was able to demonstrate that awak-
ening after a single dose of thiopental was primarily the result of
redistribution of thiopental from the brain to the muscle with little
contribution by distribution to less well-perfused tissues or drug
metabolism. This fundamental concept of redistribution applies
to all lipophilic drugs and was not delineated until an accurate
pharmacokinetic model had been constructed.
Perfusion-based physiologic pharmacokinetic models have
provided significant insights into how physiologic, pharmaco-
logic, and pathologic distribution of cardiac output can affect
drug distribution and elimination.29,30 However, verification of
the predictions of these models requires measurement of drug
concentrations in many different tissues, which is impractical.
Therefore, simpler mathematical models have been developed.
In these models, the body is comprised of one or more compart-
ments. Drug concentrations in the blood are used to define the
relationship between dose and the time course of changes in the
drug concentration. The compartments of the compartmental
pharmacokinetic models cannot be equated with the tissue groups
that make up physiologic pharmacokinetic models because the
compartments are theoretical entities that are used to mathemati-
cally characterize the blood concentration profile of a drug. These
models allow the derivation of pharmacokinetic parameters that
can be used to quantify drug distribution and elimination—
volume of distribution, clearance, and half-lives.
Although the simplicity of compartmental models, compared
to physiologic pharmacokinetic models, has advantages, there
are also some disadvantages. For example, cardiac output is not a
parameter of compartmental models, and compartmental models
therefore cannot be used to predict the effect of cardiac failure
on drug disposition.31 However, compartmental pharmacokinetic
models can still quantify the effects of reduced cardiac output on
the disposition of a drug if a group of patients with cardiac failure
is compared to a group of healthy subjects.
The discipline of pharmacokinetics is—to the despair of
many—mathematically based. In the succeeding sections, for-
mulas are used to illustrate the concepts needed to understand
and interpret pharmacokinetic studies. Readers are encouraged to
concentrate on the concepts, not the formulas.
Pharmacokinetic Concepts
The disposition of most drugs follows first-order kinetics. A
first-order kinetic process is one in which a constant fraction
of the drug is removed during a finite period of time, regardless of
the drug amount or concentration. This fraction is equivalent to the
rate constant of the process. Rate constants are usually denoted by
the letter k and have units of “inverse time,” such as min-1 or h-1.
If 10% of the drug is eliminated per minute, then the rate constant
is 0.1 min-1. Because a constant fraction is removed per unit of
time in first-order kinetics, the absolute amount of drug removed
is proportional to the concentration of the drug. It follows that, in
first-order kinetics, the rate of change of the amount of drug at any
given time is proportional to the concentration present at that time.
When the concentration is high, more drug will be removed than
when it is low. First-order kinetics apply not only to elimination,
but also to absorption and distribution.
Rather than using rate constants, the rapidity of pharmaco-
kinetic processes is often described with half-lives—the time
required for the concentration to change by a factor of 2. Half-
lives are calculated directly from the corresponding rate constants
with this simple equation:
(11-6)
In 2 0.693
Thus, a rate constant of 0.1 min-1 translates into a half-life
of 6.93 minutes. The half-life of any first-order kinetic process,
including drug absorption, distribution, and elimination, can be
calculated. First-order processes asymptotically approach com-
pletion because a constant fraction of the drug, not an absolute
amount, is removed per unit of time. However, after five half-
lives, the process will be almost 97% complete (Table 11-4). For
practical purposes, this is essentially 100%, and therefore, there is
a negligible amount of drug remaining in the body.

Volume of Distribution
6 The volume of distribution quantifies the extent of drug distribu-
tion. The physiologic factor that governs the extent of drug distri-
bution is the overall capacity of tissues versus the capacity of blood
for that drug. Overall tissue capacity for uptake of a drug is in turn
a function of the total mass of the tissues into which a drug distrib-
utes and their average affinity for the drug. In compartmental phar-
macokinetic models, drugs are envisaged as distributed into one or
more “boxes,” or compartments. These compartments cannot be
equated directly with specific tissues. Rather, they are hypothetical
entities that permit analysis of drug distribution and elimination
and description of the drug concentration versus time profile.
The volume of distribution is an “apparent” volume because it
represents the size of these hypothetical boxes, or compartments,
that are necessary to explain the concentration of drug in a reference
compartment, usually called the central or plasma compartment.
The volume of distribution, Vd, relates the total amount of drug
present to the concentration observed in the central compartment:
amount of drug administered
initial drug plasma concentration
If a drug is extensively distributed, then the concentration will
be lower relative to the amount of drug present, which equates to
a larger volume of distribution. For example, if a total of 10 mg of
drug is present and the concentration is 2 mg/L, then the apparent
volume of distribution is 5 L. On the other hand, if the concentra-
tion was 4 mg/L, then the volume of distribution would be 2.5 L.
Simply stated, the apparent volume of distribution is a numeric
index of the extent of drug distribution that does not have any
relationship to the actual volume of any tissue or group of tissues.
It may be as small as plasma volume, or, if overall tissue uptake
is extensive, the apparent volume of distribution may exceed the
total volume of the body. In general, lipophilic drugs have larger
volumes of distribution than hydrophilic drugs. Because the vol-
ume of distribution is a mathematical construct to model the dis-
tribution of a drug in the body, the volume of distribution cannot
provide any information regarding the actual tissue concentration
in any specific real organ in the body. However, this simple math-
ematical construct provides a useful summary of the behavior of
the drug in the body. In fact, the loading dose of drug required to
achieve a target plasma concentration can be easily calculated by
rearranging Equation 11-7 as follows:
Loading Dose = Vd x Target Concentration (11-8)
Based on this equation, it is clear that an increase in the vol-
ume of distribution means that a larger loading dose will be
required to “fill up the box” and achieve the same concentration.
Therefore, any change in state because of changes in physiologic
and pathologic conditions can alter the volume of distribution,
necessitating dosing adjustments.
Total Drug (Elimination) Clearance
Elimination clearance (drug clearance) is the theoretical volume of 7
blood from which drug is completely and irreversibly removed in a
unit of time. Elimination clearance has the units of flow - volume
per time. Total drug clearance can be calculated with pharmacoki-
netic models of blood concentration versus time data. Drug clear-
ance is often corrected for weight or body surface area, in which
case, the units are mL/min/kg or mL/min/m2, respectively.
Elimination clearance, Cl, can be calculated from the declining
blood levels observed after an IV injection, as follows:
dose of drug administered (119)
area under the concentration versus time curve
If a drug is rapidly removed from the plasma, its concentra-
tion will fall more quickly than the concentration of a drug that
is less readily eliminated. This results in a smaller area under the
concentration versus time curve, which equates to greater clear-
ance (Fig. 11-4).
Without additional organ-specific data (e.g., urine drug con-
centration measurements, drug arterial inflow concentration)
calculating elimination clearance from compartmental pharmaco-
kinetic models usually does not specify the relative contribution
of different organs to drug elimination. Nonetheless, estimation of
drug clearance with these models has made important contribu-
tions to clinical pharmacology. In particular, these models have
provided a great deal of clinically useful information regarding
altered drug elimination in various pathologic conditions.
Elimination Half-Life
Although the elimination clearance is the pharmacokinetic
parameter that best describes the physiologic process of drug
elimination (i.e., drug delivery to organs of elimination coupled
with the capacity of the organ to eliminate the drug), the phar-
macokinetic variable most often reported in textbooks and litera-
ture is the elimination half-life of a drug (t1/2p). The elimination
half-life is the time during which the amount of drug in the body

tion clearance. Notice that the areas under the curves are different,
signifying that the drug that has the smaller area under the curve is
more rapidly eliminated from the body than the drug that has the
slower elimination clearance.
234
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
decreases by 50%. Although this parameter appears to be a simple
summary of the physiology of drug elimination, it is actually a
complex parameter, influenced by the distribution and the elimi-
nation of the drug, as follows:
h/2, = ^ = 0.693 x-^. (11-10)
Therefore, when a physiologic or pathologic perturbation
changes the elimination half-life of a drug, it is not a simple reflec-
tion of a change in the body’s ability to metabolize or eliminate
the drug. For example, the elimination half-life of thiopental is
prolonged in the elderly; however, the elimination clearance is
unchanged and the volume of distribution is increased.32 There-
fore, elderly patients need dosing strategies that accommodate
for a change in the distribution of the drug rather than decreased
metabolism of the drug. In contrast, in patients with renal insuf-
ficiency, the increase in the elimination half-life of pancuronium
is due to a simple decrease in renal drug elimination, and the vol-
ume of distribution is unchanged.33
Aside from its inability to give insight into the mechanism by
which a drug is retained in the body, the elimination half-life is
unable to give insight into the time that it takes for a single dose
or a series of repeated drug doses to terminate its effect. Although
elimination of drug from the body begins the moment the drug
is delivered to the organs of elimination, the rapid termination
of effect of a bolus of an IV agent is due to redistribution of drug
from the brain to the blood and subsequently other tissues (e.g.,
muscle). Therefore, the effects of most anesthetics have waned
long before even one elimination half-life has been completed,
making this measure of drug kinetics incapable of providing use-
ful information regarding the duration of action following the
administration of IV agents. Thus, the elimination half-life has
limited utility in anesthetic practice.10
Effect of Hepatic or Renal Disease on
Pharmacokinetic Parameters
Diverse pathophysiologic changes preclude precise prediction
of the pharmacokinetics of a given drug in individual patients
with hepatic or renal disease. In addition, liver function tests
are unreliable predictors of the degree of liver function and the
remaining metabolic capacity for drug elimination. However,
some generalizations can be made. In patients with hepatic dis-
ease, the elimination half-life of drugs metabolized or excreted by
the liver is often increased because of decreased clearance, and,
possibly, increased volume of distribution caused by ascites and
altered protein binding. 10,3‘’ Drug concentration at steady state is
inversely proportional to elimination clearance. Therefore, when
hepatic drug clearance is reduced, repeated bolus dosing or con-
tinuous infusion of such drugs as benzodiazepines, opioids, and
barbiturates may result in accumulation of drug as well as exces-
sive and prolonged pharmacologic effects. Since recovery from
small doses of drugs such as thiopental and fentanyl is largely
the result of redistribution, recovery from conservative doses will
be minimally affected by reductions in elimination clearance. In
patients with renal failure, similar concerns apply to the adminis-
tration of drugs excreted by the kidneys. A prudent approach is to
underestimate a patient’s dose requirement, observe the response,
and give additional drug if necessary.
Nonlinear Pharmacokinetics
The physiologic and compartmental models thus far discussed
are based on the assumption that drug distribution and elimina-
tion are first-order processes. Therefore, their parameters, such as
clearance and elimination half-life, are independent of the dose or
concentration of the drug. However, the rate of elimination of a
few drugs is dose-dependent, or nonlinear.
Elimination of drugs involves interactions with either enzymes
catalyzing biotransformation reactions or carrier proteins for
transmembrane transport. If sufficient drug is present, the capac-
ity of the drug-eliminating systems can be exceeded. When this
occurs, it is no longer possible to excrete a constant fraction of the
drug present, and a constant amount of drug is excreted per unit
time. Phenytoin is a well-known example of a drug that exhibits
nonlinear elimination at therapeutic concentrations;33 however,
when high doses of thiopental are utilized for cerebral protec-
tion, it can demonstrate zero-order elimination.36 In theory, all
drugs are cleared in a nonlinear fashion. In practice, the capacity
to eliminate most drugs is so great that this is usually not evident,
even with supratherapeutic concentrations.
Compartmental Pharmacokinetic • .tefe
One-Compartment Model
Although for most drugs the one-compartment model is an over-
simplification, it does serve to illustrate the basic relationships
among clearance, volume of distribution, and the elimination
half-life. In this model, the body is envisaged as a single homoge-
neous compartment. Drug distribution after injection is assumed
to be instantaneous, so there are no concentration gradients
within the compartment. The concentration can decrease only by
elimination of drug from the system. The plasma concentration
versus time curve for a hypothetical drug with one-compartment
kinetics is shown in Figure 11-5. The decrease in plasma concen-
tration (C) with time from the initial concentration (Co) can be
characterized by the simple monoexponential function:
C(t) = Coxe-^x‘ (11-11)
With the concentration plotted on a logarithmic scale, the con-
centration versus time curve becomes a straight line. The slope of
the logarithm of concentration versus time is equal to the first-
order elimination rate constant (he).
In the one-compartment model, drug clearance, Cl, is equal to
the product of the elimination rate constant, ke, and the volume
of distribution:
(11-12)
CI = ke-Vd
Figure 11-5 The plasma concentration versus time profile plotted
on both linear (blue line, left y-axis) and logarithmic (red line, right
y-axis) scales for a hypothetical drug exhibiting one-compartment, first-
order pharmacokinetics. Note that the slope of the logarithmic concen-
tration profile is equal to the elimination rate constant (kJ and related
to the elimination half-life (t1/2p) as described in Equation 11-9.
11 Basic Principles of Clinical Pharmacology
Combining Equations 11-6 and 11-11 yields Equation 11-13
(where ke = kp):
ti/2p = ^ = 0.693 x (11-13)
Ke ClE
8 Therefore, when it is appropriate to make the simplifying
assumption of instantaneous mixing of drug into a single com-
partment, the elimination half-life is inversely proportional to
the slope of the concentration-time curve. For drugs that require
consideration of their multicompartmental pharmacokinetics,
the relationship among clearance, volume of distribution,
and the elimination half-life is not a simple linear one such as
Equation 11-13. Nevertheless, the same principles apply. All else
being equal, the greater the clearance, the shorter the elimina-
tion half-life; the larger the volume of distribution, the longer the
elimination half-life. Thus, the elimination half-life depends on
two other variables, clearance and volume of distribution, that
characterize, respectively, the extent of drug distribution and effi-
ciency of drug elimination.
Two-Compartment Model
For many drugs, a graph of the logarithm of the plasma concen-
tration versus time after an IV injection is similar to the schematic
graph shown in Figure 11-6. There are two discrete phases in the
decline of the plasma concentration. The first phase after injection
is characterized by a very rapid decrease in concentration. The
rapid decrease in concentration during this “distribution phase”
is largely caused by passage of drug from the plasma into tissues.
The distribution phase is followed by a slower decline of the con-
centration, owing to drug elimination. Elimination also begins
immediately after injection, but its contribution to the drop in
plasma concentration is initially much smaller than the fall in
concentration because of drug distribution.
To account for this biphasic behavior, one must consider the
body to be made up of two compartments: a central compart-
ment, which includes the plasma, and a peripheral compart-
ment (Fig. 11-7). This two-compartment model assumes that it
is the central compartment into which the drug is injected and
from which the blood samples for measurement of concentration
are obtained, and that drug is eliminated only from the central
Figure 11-6 The logarithmic plasma concentration versus time pro-
file for a hypothetical drug exhibiting two-compartment, first-order
pharmacokinetics. Note that the distribution phase has a slope that is
significantly larger than that of the elimination phase, indicating that
the process of distribution is not only more rapid than elimination of
the drug from the body, but also responsible for most of the decline in
plasma concentration in the several minutes after drug administration.

model. See text for explanation.
compartment. Drug distribution within the central compartment
is considered to be instantaneous. In reality, this cannot be true.
However, drug uptake into some of the highly perfused tissues
is so rapid that it cannot be detected as a discrete phase on the
plasma concentration versus time curve.
The distribution and elimination phases can be characterized
by graphic analysis of the plasma concentration versus time curve,
as shown in Figure 11-6. The elimination phase line is extrapo-
lated back to time zero (the time of injection). In Figure 11-6,
the zero time intercepts of the distribution and elimination lines
are points A and B, respectively. The hybrid rate constants, a and
P, are equal to the slopes of the two lines, and are used to calcu-
late the distribution and elimination half-lives; a and p are called
hybrid rate constants because they depend on both distribution
and elimination processes.
At any time after an IV injection, the plasma concentration of
drugs with two-compartment kinetics is equal to the sum of two
exponential terms:
Cp(t)=Ae-ai + Be-pt (11-14)
where t = time, Cp(t) = plasma concentration at time t, A — y-axis
intercept of the distribution phase line, a = hybrid rate constant
of the distribution phase, B = y-axis intercept of the elimination
phase line, and P = hybrid rate constant of the elimination phase.
The first term characterizes the distribution phase and the second
term characterizes the elimination phase. Immediately after injec-
tion, the first term represents a much larger fraction of the total
plasma concentration than the second term. After several distri-
bution half-lives, the value of the first term approaches zero, and
the plasma concentration is essentially equal to the value of the
second term (Fig. 11-6).
In multicompartmental models, the drug is initially distrib-
uted only within the central compartment. Therefore, the ini-
tial apparent volume of distribution is the volume of the central
compartment. Immediately after injection, the amount of drug
present is the dose, and the concentration is the extrapolated
concentration at time t = 0, which is equal to the sum of the
intercepts of the distribution and elimination lines. The vol-
ume of the central compartment, VB is calculated by modifying
Equation 11-7:
(11-15)

initial plasma concentration A + B
The volume of the central compartment is important in clini-
cal anesthesiology because it is the pharmacokinetic parameter
that determines the peak plasma concentration after an IV bolus
injection. Hypovolemia, for example, reduces the volume of the
236
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
central compartment. If doses are not correspondingly reduced,
the higher plasma concentrations will increase the incidence of
adverse pharmacologic effects.
Immediately after IV injection, all of the drug is in the central
compartment. Simultaneously, three processes begin. Drug moves
from the central to the peripheral compartment, which also has
a volume, V2. This intercompartmental transfer is a first-order
process, and its magnitude is quantified by the rate constant k12.
As soon as drug appears in the peripheral compartment, some
pass back to the central compartment, a process characterized by
the rate constant k21. The transfer of drug between the central
and peripheral compartments is quantified by the distributional or
intercompartmental clearance:
Intercompartmental Clearance = Cl12 - Cl21 = Vj x k12 = V2 x k21
(11-16)
The third process that begins immediately after administration
of the drug is irreversible removal of drug from the system via
the central compartment. As in the one-compartment model, the
elimination rate constant is J?e, and elimination clearance is:
Elimination Clearance = ClE = V2 x kc (11-17)
The rapidity of the decrease in the central compartment con-
centration after IV injection depends on the magnitude of the
compartmental volumes, the intercompartmental clearance, and
the elimination clearance.
At equilibrium, the drug is distributed between the central and
the peripheral compartments, and by definition, the drug concen-
trations in the compartments are equal. Therefore, the ultimate
volume of distribution, termed the volume of distribution at
steady slate (Vss), is the sum of V2 and V2. Extensive tissue uptake
of a drug is reflected by a large volume of the peripheral compart-
ment, which, in turn, results in a large Vss. Consequently, Vss can
greatly exceed the actual volume of the body.
As in the single-compartment model, in multicompartment
models, the elimination clearance is equal to the dose divided by
the area under the concentration versus time curve. This area,
as well as the compartmental volumes and intercompartmental
clearances, can be calculated from the intercepts and hybrid rate
constants, without having to reach steady-state conditions.
Three-Compartment Model
After IV injection of some drugs, the initial, rapid distribution
phase is followed by a second, slower distribution phase before
the elimination phase becomes evident. Therefore, the plasma
concentration is the sum of three exponential terms:
Cp(t) = Ae""' + Be-p' + Ge’1" (11-18)
where I = time, Cp(t) = plasma concentration at time t, A = inter-
cept of the rapid distribution phase line, a = hybrid rate constant
of the rapid distribution phase, B = intercept of the slower dis-
tribution phase line, 0 = hybrid rate constant of the slower dis-
tribution phase, G = intercept of the elimination phase line, and
y = hybrid rate constant of the elimination phase. This triphasic
behavior is explained by a three-compartment pharmacokinetic
model (Fig. 11-8). As in the two-compartment model, the drug is
injected into and eliminated from the central compartment. Drug
is reversibly transferred between the central compartment and two
peripheral compartments, which accounts for two distribution
phases. Drug transfer between the central compartment and the
more rapidly equilibrating, or “shallow,” peripheral compartment
is characterized by the first-order rate constants kl2 and h21. Trans-
fer in and out of the more slowly equilibrating, “deep” compart-
ment is characterized by the rate constants kl2 and k21. In this
Dose

model. See text for details.
model, there are three compartmental volumes: Vb V2, and V3,
whose sum equals Vss; and three clearances: the rapid intercom-
partmental clearance, the slow intercompartmental clearance, and
elimination clearance.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of interest to clinicians,
such as clearance, volumes of distribution, and distribution and
elimination half-lives, are determined by calculations analogous
to those used in the two-compartment model. Accurate estimates
of these parameters depend on accurate characterization of the
measured plasma concentration versus time data. A frequently
encountered problem is that the duration of sampling is not
long enough to define accurately the elimination phase. Similar
problems arise if the assay cannot detect low concentrations of
the drug. Conversely, samples are sometimes obtained too infre-
quently following drug administration to be able to character-
ize the distribution phases.37,38 Whether a drug exhibits two- or
three-compartment kinetics is of no clinical consequence.10 In
fact, some drugs have two-compartment kinetics in some patients
and three-compartment kinetics in others. In selecting a pharma-
cokinetic model, the most important factor is that it accurately
characterizes the measured concentrations.
In general, the model with the smallest number of compart-
ments or exponents that accurately reflects the data is used.
However, it is good to consider that the data collected in a par-
ticular study may not be reflective of the clinical pharmaco-
logic issues of concern in another situation, making published
pharmacokinetic model parameters potentially irrelevant. For
instance, suppose new data indicate that hypotension following
IV administration of drug X is related to peak arterial plasma
drug X concentrations 1 minute after injection, but previous
pharmacokinetic models were based on venous plasma drug X
concentrations beginning 5 minutes after the dose. In this case,
the pharmacokinetic model will not be of use in designing dos-
ing regimens for drug X that avoid toxic drug concentrations at
1 minute.10,39,40
Almost all earlier pharmacokinetic studies used two-stage
modeling. With this technique, pharmacokinetic parameters were
estimated independendy for each subject and then averaged to
provide estimates of the typical parameters for the population.
One problem with this approach is that if outliers are present,
averaging parameters could result in a model that does not
accurately predict typical drug concentrations. Currently, most
pharmacokinetic models are developed using population phar-
macokinetic modeling, which has been made feasible because of
advances in modeling software and increased computing power.
With these techniques, the pharmacokinetic parameters are esti-
mated using all the concentration versus time data from the enure
group of subjects in a single stage, with the help of sophisticated
nonlinear regression methods.
11 Basic Principles of Clinical Pharmacology
NoncompartmentaO (Stochastic)
Pharmacokinetic Models
Often, investigators performing pharmacokinetic analyses of
drugs want to avoid the experimental requirements of a physi-
ologic model—data or empirical estimations of individual organ
inflow and outflow concentration profiles and organ tissue drug
concentrations are required in order to identify the components of
the model.41 Although compartmental models do not assume any
physiologic or anatomic basis for the model structure, investiga-
tors often attribute anatomic and physiologic function to these
empiric models.42 Even if the disciplined clinical pharmacologist
avoids overinterpretation of the meaning of compartment models,
the simple fact that several competing models can provide equally
good descriptions of the mathematical data, or that some subjects
in a data set may better fit with a three-compartment model rather
than the two-compartment model that provides the best fit for
the other data set subjects, leads many to question whether there
is a true best model architecture for any given drug. As a result,
some investigators prefer to employ mathematical techniques to
characterize pharmacokinetic data that attempt to avoid any pre-
conceived notion of structure, and yet yield the pharmacokinetic
parameters that summarize drug distribution and elimination.
These techniques are classified as noncompartmental techniques
or stochastic techniques and are similar to the methods utilized in
process analysis of chemical engineering systems. Although these
techniques are often called model independent, like any math-
ematical construct, assumptions must be made to simplify the
mathematics. The basic assumptions of noncompartmental anal-
ysis are that (1) all of the elimination clearance occurs direcdy
from the plasma; (2) the distribution and elimination of drug is
a linear and first-order process, and (3) the pharmacokinetics of
the system does not vary over the time of the data collection (time
invariant). All of these assumptions are also made in the basic
compartmental and most physiologic models. Therefore, the main
advantage of noncompartmental pharmacokinetic methods is that
a general description of drug absorption, distribution, and elimi-
nation can be made without resorting to more complex mathe-
matical modeling techniques.41
Another appealing facet of noncompartmental analysis is that
the parameters that describe drug distribution (volume of distri-
bution at steady-state, Vd^) and drug elimination (elimination
clearance, C1E) are analogous to parameters found in other phar-
macokinetic techniques. In fact, when properly defined, the esti-
mates of these parameters from the noncompartmental approach
and a well-defined compartmental model yield similar values.
The main unique parameter of noncompartmental analysis is the
mean residence time (MRT), which is the average time a drug
molecule spends in the body before being eliminated.43 The MRT,
unfortunately, suffers from the main failings of the elimination
half-life derived from compartmental models—not only does it
fail to capture the contribution of extensive distribution versus
limited elimination to allow a drug to linger in the body, but both
parameters also fail to describe the situation where the drug effect
can dissipate by redistribution of drug from the site of action back
into blood and then into other, less well-perfused tissues.44
Neural Networks and Artificial
Intelligence
In 1943, neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathemati-
cian Walter Pitts introduced the concept of the “nervous net”.45
This network—analogous to the network of synapses formed by
neurons in the animal brain—allows the computation of a suc-
ceeding state from the description of a previous state. This sentinel

manuscript formed the concept of neural networks. Only 7 years
later, the concept of artificial intelligence was introduced by Alan
Turing, who described a computer’s ability to achieve human-level
performance in cognitive tasks.46
Neural networks are the most popular type of artificial intel-
ligence used in medicine47 and are comprised of networks of
interconnected computer processors that can perform computa-
tions in parallel. These networks are organized in a series of layers
including an input layer, various hidden layers, and an output
layer (Fig. 11-9). Neural networks can analyze complex, nonlin-
ear data and are not limited to a preset model structure. In this
regard, they are initially stochastic in nature.
It took nearly 50 years for neural networks to be applied
toward modeling medical data.48-52 At the same time, they were
also being used to model pharmacokinetic data.53-55 Neural net-
works were shown to be superior to a Bayesian approach when
estimating the area under the curve.53 Brier et al. used neural net-
works to model gentamicin steady-state concentrations with less
prediction error compared to mixed effects models.56 Since neural
networks are not confined to a specific structural model, they are
not as prone to model misspecification?3
Recendy, Lee et al. demonstrated the superiority of neural
networks compared to response surface models in predicting
processed EEG values based on propofol and remifentanil tar-
get-controlled infusion (TCI) rates.57 Their model incorporated
over 2 million data points and remarkably, took less than 2 hours
to complete—much shorter than what is required using mixed
effects models—as neural networks, being parallel, can utilize a
computer’s graphical processing unit.
The success of neural networks at modeling pharmacometrics
data—and medical data in general—has seen them being cham-
pioned as potential replacements for other techniques currently
in use.58 However, though powerful in their ability to model
complex, nonlinear data, neural networks have several limita-
tions. Neural networks require large amounts of data to first train
and subsequently validate the model. When training datasets
are small, unacceptably high variance may result.59 Therefore,
the utility of neural networks to model prospectively acquired
pharamacokinetic or pharmacodynamic data may be limited by
the relative lack of data available to train the model.60 Also, neural
networks lack a conceptual basis and therefore require access to
artificial intelligence computation.
Nevertheless,_ with large datasets, neural networks are reli-
able and valid.57 Automated, closed-loop drug delivery using
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
artificial intelligence and sensors monitoring depth of anesthesia
and nociception has been touted as a possible means to improve
patient safety and care.61 Whether this prediction comes to frui-
tion remains to be seen.
Pharmacodynamic Principles
Much of the clinical pharmacology efforts of the late 1980s and
1990s were devoted to applying the new computational power
of desktop computers to deciphering the pharmacokinetics of
IV anesthetics. However, the premise behind developing mod-
els to better characterize and understand the effects of various
physiologic and pathologic states on drug distribution and
elimination was that the relationship between a drug dose and
its effect(s) had already been characterized. As computational
power and drug assay technology grew, it became possible to
characterize the relationship between a drug concentration and
the associated pharmacologic effect. As a result, pharmacody-
namic studies since the 1990s have focused on the quantitative
analysis of the relationship between the drug concentration in
the blood and the resultant effects of the drug on physiologic
processes.
Interactions
9 Most pharmacologic agents produce their physiologic effects by
binding to a specific receptor, which brings about a change in cel-
lular function. The majority of pharmacologic receptors are cell
membrane proteins, although some receptors are located in the
cytoplasm or the nucleoplasm of the cell.
Binding of drugs to receptors, like the binding of drugs to
plasma proteins, is usually reversible, and follows the law of mass
action:
[drag] + [receptor] [drug - receptor complex] (11-19)
This relationship demonstrates that the higher the con-
centration of free drug or unoccupied receptor, the greater the
tendency to form the drug-receptor complex. Plotting the per-
centage of receptors occupied by a drug against the logarithm of
the concentration of the drug yields a sigmoid curve, as shown in
Figure 11-10.62
The percentage of receptors occupied by a drug is not
equivalent to the percentage of maximal effect produced by the
drug. In fact, most receptor systems have more receptors than
required to obtain the maximum drug effect.63 The presence of
“extra” unoccupied receptors will promote the formation of the
drug-receptor complex (Law of Mass Action, Equation 11-19);
therefore, near-maximal drug effects can occur at very low drug
concentrations. This not only allows extremely efficient responses
to drugs, but it provides a large margin of safety—an extremely
large number of a drug’s receptors must be bound to an antagonist
before the drug is unable to produce its pharmacologic effect. For
example, at the neuromuscular junction, only 20% to 25% of the
postjunctional nicotinic cholinergic receptors need to bind ace-
tylcholine to produce contraction of all the fibers in the muscle,
while 75% of the receptors must be blocked by a nondepolarizing
neuromuscular antagonist to produce a significant drop in muscle
strength. This accounts for the “margin of safety” of neuromuscu-
lar transmission.63
The binding of drugs to receptors and the resulting changes
in cellular function are the last two steps in the complex series
of events between administration of a drug and production of
its pharmacologic effects. There are two primary schemes by
which the binding of an agonist to a receptor changes cellu-
lar function: receptor-linked membrane ion channels called
ionophores, and guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, referred
to as G-proteins. The nicotinic cholinergic receptor in the
neuromuscular postsynaptic membrane is one example of a
receptor-ionophore complex. Binding of acetylcholine opens
the cation ionophore, leading to an influx of Na+ ions, propaga-
tion of an action potential, and, ultimately, muscle contraction.
The y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-chloride ionophore
complex is another example of this type of effector mecha-
nism. Binding of either endogenous neurotransmitters (GABA)
or exogenous agonists (benzodiazepines and IV anesthetics)
increases Cl" conductance, which hyperpolarizes the neuron
and decreases its excitability. Adrenergic receptors are the pro-
totypical G-protein coupled receptors. G-proteins change the
intracellular concentrations of various so-called second messen-
gers, such as Ca2+ and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP),
in order to transduce their signal and produce modified cellular
behavior.
Desensitization and Downregulation
of Receptors
Receptors are not static entities. Rather, they are dynamic
cellular components that adapt to their environment
(D4 Video 11-1). Prolonged exposure of a receptor to its
agonist leads to desensitization—subsequent doses of the ago-
nist will produce lower maximal effects. With sustained eleva-
tion of the cytosolic second messengers downstream of the
G-proteins, pathways to prevent further G-protein signaling
are activated. Phosphorylation by G-protein receptor kinases
and arrestin-mediated blockade of the coupling site needed
to form the active heterotrimeric G-protein complex prevents
Dose
Figure 11-10 A schematic curve of the effect of
a drug plotted against dose. In the left panel, the
response data is plotted against the dose data on a linear
scale. In the right panel, the same response data are plot-
ted against the dose data on a logarithmic scale yielding a
sigmoid dose-response curve that is linear between 20%
and 80% of the maximal effect.
11 Basic Principles of Clinical Pharmacology
G-protein-coupled receptors from becoming active. Arres-
tins and other cell membrane proteins can tag receptors that
have sustained activity, so that these non-G-protein receptors
are internalized and sequestered so they are no longer acces-
sible to agonists. Similar mechanisms will prevent the traffick-
ing of stored receptors to the cell membrane. The combined
increased rate of internalization and decreased rate of replen-
ishing of receptor results in downregulation—a decrease in the
total number of receptors. Signals that produce downregulation
with sustained receptor activation are essentially reversed in
the face of constant receptor inactivity. Therefore, chronically
denervated neuromuscular junctions, just like cardiac tissue
constantly bathed with adrenergic antagonists, will upregulate
the specific receptors in an attempt to produce a signal in the
face of lower concentrations of agonists.
Agonists, SPartial Agonists, and Antagonists
Drugs that bind to receptors and produce an effect are called ago-
nists. Different drugs that act on the same receptor may be capable
of producing the same maximal effect (Emax), although they may
differ in the concentration that produces the effect (i.e., potency).
Agonists that differ in potency but bind to the same receptors will
have parallel concentration-response curves (Fig. 11-11, curves
Figure 11-11 Schematic pharmacodynamic curves, with dose or
concentration on the x-axis and effect or receptor occupancy on the
y-axis, that illustrate agonism, partial agonism, and antagonism. Drug
A produces a maximum effect, Emax, and a 50% of maximal effect at
dose or concentration E50,a- Drug B, a full agonist, can produce the
maximum effect, Emax; however, it is less potent (Eso B > Eso A). Drug
C, a partial agonist, can only produce a maximum effect of approxi-
mately 50% Emax. If a competitive antagonist is given to a patient,
the dose response for the agonist would shift from curve A to curve
B—although the receptors would have the same affinity for the ago-
nist, the presence of the competitor would necessitate an increase in
agonist in order to produce an effect. In fact, the agonist would still be
able to produce a maximal effect, if a sufficient overdose was given to
displace the competitive antagonist. However, the competitive antag-
onist would not change the binding characteristics of the receptor for
the agonist and so curve B is simply shifted to the right but remains
parallel to curve A. In contrast, if a noncompetitive antagonist binds
to the receptor, the agonist would no longer be able to produce a
maximal effect, no matter how much of an overdose is administered
(curve C).
A and B). Differences in potency of agonists reflect differences
in affinity for the receptor. Partial agonists are drugs that are not
capable of producing the maximal effect, even at very high con-
centrations (Fig. 11-11, curve C).
Compounds that bind to receptors without producing any
changes in cellular function are referred to as antagonists—
antagonists make it impossible for agonists to bind their recep-
tors. Competitive antagonists bind reversibly to receptors, and
their blocking effect can be overcome by high concentrations
of an agonist (i.e., competition). Therefore, competitive antago-
nists produce a parallel shift in the dose-response curve, but the
maximum effect is not altered (Fig. 11-11, curves A and B). Non-
competitive antagonists bind irreversibly to receptors. This has the
same effect as reducing the number of receptors and shifting the
dose-response curve downward and to the right, decreasing both
the slope and the maximum effect (Fig. 11-11, curves A and C).
The effect of noncompetitive antagonists is reversed only by syn-
thesis of new receptor molecules.
Agonists produce a structural change in the receptor molecule
that initiates changes in cellular function. Partial agonists may
produce a qualitatively different change in the receptor, whereas
antagonists bind without producing a change in the receptor that
results in altered cellular function. The underlying mechanisms by
which different compounds that bind to the same receptor act as
agonists, partial agonists, or antagonists are not fully understood.
Dose-Response Re/at/onsh7ps
Dose-response studies determine the relationship between
increasing doses of a drug and the ensuing changes in pharma-
cologic effects. Schematic dose-response curves are shown in
Figure 11-10, with the dose plotted on both linear and logarith-
mic scales. There is a curvilinear relationship between dose and
the intensity of response. Low doses produce litde pharmacologic
effect. Once effects become evident, a small increase in dose pro-
duces a relatively large change in effect. At near-maximal response,
large increases in dose produce litde change in effect. Usually, the
dose is plotted on a logarithmic scale (Fig. 11-10, right panel),
which demonstrates the linear relationship between the logarithm
of the dose and the intensity of the response between 20% and
80% of the maximum effect.
Acquiring the pharmacologic effect data from a population of
subjects exposed to a variety of doses of a drug provides four key
characteristics of the drug dose-response relationship—potency,
drug-receptor affinity, efficacy, and population pharmacodynamic
variability. The potency of the drug—the dose required to produce
a given effect—is usually expressed as the dose required to pro-
duce a given effect in 50% of subjects, the ED50. The slope of the
curve between 20% and 80% of the maximal effect indicates the
rate of increase in effect as the dose is increased and is a reflection
of the affinity of the receptor for the drug. The maximum effect is
referred to as the efficacy of the drug. Finally, if curves from mul-
tiple subjects are generated, the variability in potency, efficacy, and
the slope of the dose-response curve can be estimated.
The dose needed to produce a given pharmacologic effect var- 10
ies considerably, even in “normal” patients. The patient who is
most resistant to a drug usually requires a dose two- to threefold
greater than the patient who has the lowest dose requirement.
This variability is caused by differences among individuals in
the relationship between drug concentration and pharmaco-
logic effect, superimposed on differences in pharmacokinetics.
Dose-response studies have the disadvantage of not being able
to determine whether variations in pharmacologic response are
caused by differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
or both.

Concentration-Response Relationships
The onset and duration of pharmacologic effects depend not only
on pharmacokinetic factors but also on the pharmacodynamic
factors governing the degree of temporal disequilibrium between
changes in concentration and changes in effect. The magnitude of
the pharmacologic effect is a function of the amount of drug pres-
ent at the site of action, so increasing the dose increases the peak
effect. Larger doses have a more rapid onset of action because
pharmacologically active concentrations at the site of action occur
sooner. Increasing the dose also increases the duration of action
because pharmacologically effective concentrations are main-
tained for a longer time.
Ideally, the concentration of drug at its site of action should
be used to define the concentration-response relationship
(EK Video 11-2). Unfortunately, these data are rarely available,
so the relationship between the concentration of drug in the
blood and pharmacologic effect is studied instead. This relation-
ship is easiest to understand if the changes in pharmacologic
effect that occur during and after an IV infusion of a hypotheti-
cal drug are considered. If a drug is infused at a constant rate,
the plasma concentration initially increases rapidly and asymp-
totically approaches a steady-state level after approximately five
elimination half-lives have elapsed (Fig. 11-12). The effect of
the drug initially increases very slowly, then more rapidly, and
eventually also reaches a steady state. When the infusion is dis-
continued, indicated by point C in Figure 11-12, the plasma
concentration immediately decreases because of drug distribu-
tion and elimination. However, the effect stays the same for a
short period, and then also begins to decrease; there is always a
time lag between changes in plasma concentration and changes
in pharmacologic response. Figure 11-12 also demonstrates
that the same plasma concentration is associated with different
responses if the concentration is changing. At points A and B in
Figure 11-12, the plasma concentrations are the same, but the
effects at each time differ. When the concentration is increasing,
there is a concentration gradient from blood to the site of action.
When the infusion is discontinued, the concentration gradient
is reversed. Therefore, at the same plasma concentration, the
concentration at the site of action is higher after, compared to
during, the infusion. This is associated with a correspondingly
greater effect.
In theory, there must be some degree of temporal disequilib-
rium between plasma concentration and drug effect for all drugs
with extravascular sites of action. However, for some drugs, the
lime lag may be so short that it cannot be demonstrated. The mag-
nitude of this temporal disequilibrium depends on several factors:
• The perfusion of the organ on which the drug acts
• The tissue:blood partition coefficient of the drug
• The rate of diffusion or transport of the drug from the blood to
the cellular site of action
• The rate and affinity of drug-receptor binding
• The time required for processes initiated by the drug-receptor
interaction to produce changes in cellular function
The consequence of this time lag between changes in concen-
tration and changes in effects is that the plasma concentration
will have an unvarying relationship with pharmacologic effect
only under steady-state conditions. At steady state, the plasma
concentration is in equilibrium with the concentrations through-
out the body and is thus directly proportional to the steady-state
concentration at the site of action. Plotting the logarithm of the
steady-state plasma concentration versus response generates a
curve identical in appearance to the dose-response curve shown
in the right panel of Figure 11-10. The Cpss50, the steady-state
plasma concentration producing 50% of the maximal response,
is determined from the concentration-response curve. Like the
ED50, the Cpss50 is a measure of sensitivity to a drug, but the
CpssSO has the advantage of being unaffected by pharmacoki-
netic variability. Because it takes five elimination half-lives to
approach steady-state conditions, it is not practical to determine
the Cpss50 directly. For drugs with long elimination half-lives, the
pseudoequilibrium during the elimination phase can be used to
approximate steady-state conditions, because the concentrations
in plasma and at the site of action are changing very slowly.
Combined Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic
Models
Integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models fully char- 11
acterize the relationships among time, dose, plasma concentra-
tion, and pharmacologic effect. This is accomplished by adding a
hypothetical “effect compartment” (biophase) to a standard com-
partmental pharmacokinetic model (Fig. 11-13).64-66 Transfer of
drug between central compartment and the effect compartment is
assumed to be a first-order process, and the pharmacologic effect is
assumed to be direcdy related to the concentration in the biophase.
Dose
Figure 11-13 A schematic of a three-compartment phar-
macokinetic model with the effect site linked to the central
compartment. The rate constant for transfer between the plasma
(central compartment) and the effect site, kle, and the volume of the
effect site are both presumed to be negligible to ensure that the effect
site does not influence the pharmacokinetic model. The rate constant
for drug removal from the effect site, which relates the concentration in
the central compartment to the pharmacologic effect is keo-
11 Basic Principles of Clinical Pharmacology
The biophase is a “virtual” compartment, although linked to the
pharmacokinetic model, and does not actually receive or return
drug to the model; therefore, the effect site processes do not influ-
ence the pharmacokinetic model. By simultaneously characteriz-
ing the pharmacokinetics of the drug and the time course of drug
effect, the combined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model
is able to quantify the temporal dissociation between the plasma
(central compartment) concentration and effect with the rate con-
stant for equilibration between the plasma and the biophase, ke0.
By quantifying the time lag between changes in plasma concentra-
tion and changes in pharmacologic effect, these models can also
define the Cpss50, even without steady-state conditions. These
models have contributed greatly to our understanding of factors
influencing the response to IV anesthetics, opioids, and nondepo-
larizing muscle relaxants in humans.
The rate of equilibration between the plasma and the biophase,
ke0, can also be characterized by the half-life of effect site equili-
bration (T1/2ke0) using the formula:
In 2 0.693
Ti/ik. — ~~;-------------
’?e0 '^f0
(11-20)
T1/2ke0 is the time for the effect site concentration to reach
50% of the plasma concentration when the plasma concentration
is held constant. For anesthetics with a short T1/2ke0 (high ke0),
equilibration between the plasma and the biophase is rapid and
therefore there is little delay before an effect is reached when a
bolus of drug is administered or a drug infusion is initiated. How-
ever, because the decline in the effect site concentration will also
depend on the concentration gradient between the effect site and
the plasma, drugs that rapidly equilibrate with the biophase may
take longer to redistribute.67 Therefore, the offset of drug effect is
more dependent on the pharmacokinetics of the body than on the
rapidity of biophase-plasma equilibration.21,67
Population Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic
Models
Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model-
ing has emerged as a nearly essential part of study design and
data analysis in the clinical pharmacology of anesthetic drugs.68
Despite the term “population,” these techniques are designed to
bring an individual’s specific physiologic characteristics into dose
regimen selection. These analyses were made possible through the
combined efforts of a theoretical statistician, Stuart Beal, and a
leading clinical pharmacologist, Lewis Sheiner, and found early
adoption in anesthesiology.69,70 Sheiner and Beal used nonlinear
mixed effects (meaning both fixed and random effects) modeling
and wrote a computer program (NONMEM) to fit PK-PD data
from multiple individuals, and even from multiple studies, while
building an overarching statistical description.71 In this way, a
typical (or median) value for each parameter (e.g., clearance, vol-
ume, EC50) of the PK-PD model (called fixed effects, or thetas, 0,
in NONMEM terminology) could be combined with a random
effect variable (eta, T], in NONMEM) that described where on the
distribution (e.g., Gaussian) of all T|s each individual T| lies for
each parameter, 0.68
With nonlinear mixed effects modeling, it is possible to
include the interindividual variability of each parameter into a
PK-PD model for the population(s) studied—an important con-
cept when trying to predict the next dose administered to the next
patient. Furthermore, the spread of the random effects (t|s) can be
reduced by including in the model each individual’s demographic
(i.e., covariate) data, for example, genomic and physiologic fac-
tors, in the form of covariates that refine the model and enhance
its ability to predict the next patient’s response to a drug.
Allometric scaling has developed as a corollary to population
PK-PD modeling. Allometry derives from an observation that
interspecies metabolism varies by an animal’s weight raised to
the 0.75 power (instead of 1.0).72 It has been widely applied
to scale pharmacokinetic models across species. More recently,
allometry has been applied to intraspecies (human) scaling
when developing population mixed effects PK-PD models at the
extremes of age (i.e., pediatric and geriatric) or size (i.e., morbid
obesity).73-75
Population PK-PD models were developed to facilitate indi-
vidualized medicine in drug therapy. However, dosing regimens
are rapidly becoming calculation intensive, with the inclusion
of increasing numbers of important covariates, especially with
additional nonlinear allometric considerations. Thus, to allow
precision dosing in the practice of anesthesiology, these complex
calculations should ideally be incorporated into drug-specific
infusion pumps (e.g., TCI pumps) or into applications the clini-
cian can have on a personal digital assistant or similar aide at the
bedside.
Therapeutic Thresholds and Therapeutic Window
The timing of the onset and the offset of drug action is not only
dependent on the effect site’s concentration profile (i.e., the drug’s
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics), but also on the mini-
mum concentration that produces a discernible drug effect—the
therapeutic threshold of the drug. The therapeutic threshold of
a drug depends on the magnitude of the desired effect or the
intensity of the stimulus being treated. For example, superficial
procedures (i.e., mastectomy, melanoma excision, etc) are not as
painful (Fig. 11-14, dashed green line) as orthopedic procedures
(i.e., long bone instrumentation, spine fusion, etc., dotted green
line). Therefore, the dose of fentanyl that produces analgesia for
superficial procedures (black solid concentration profile) does
not produce clinically discernible analgesia for the orthopedic
procedures (i.e., below the therapeutic threshold). In contrast,
the dose of fentanyl that produces analgesia for orthopedic pro-
cedures (blue solid concentration profile) will not only provide
analgesia for the superficial procedures, but it will also have a
faster onset of effect because it reaches the therapeutic thresh-
old faster. In addition, since the larger bolus of fentanyl results
in concentrations of drug that are above the toxic threshold for
the superficial procedures (red dashed line, Low toxic threshold),
the patient will have significant ventilatory depression until the
effect site concentration of fentanyl decreases below this toxic
threshold. This profound ventilatory depression would start
approximately 2 minutes after the larger bolus of fentanyl was
administered and would last for about 18 minutes after admin-
istration. The therapeutic window that should be targeted to
provide adequate analgesia after a superficial procedure is below
the toxic threshold (red dashed line) and above the therapeu-
tic threshold (green dashed line). The therapeutic window that
should be targeted for orthopedic procedures has the entire win-
dow “shifted higher” (i.e., below the red dotted line and above
the green dotted line).
Drug Interactions
Taking into account premedication, perioperative antibiotics,
IV agents used for induction or maintenance, inhalational anes-
thetics, opioids, muscle relaxants, the drugs used to restore neuro-
muscular transmission, and postoperative analgesics, 10 or more
drugs are frequently administered as part of a “routine” anes-
thetic. Consequendy, thorough understanding of the mechanisms

Figure 11-14 The effect-site concentration versus time profiles after
a small intravenous bolus (solid black line) and a larger intravenous
bolus (solid blue line) of fentanyl. Representative therapeutic thresholds
(the minimum concentration required to produce clinically discernible
analgesia), and toxic threshold (the concentration above which pro-
found opioid-induced ventilatory depression occurs) are demonstrated
superficial procedures, such as mastectomy (green dashed line, low
therapeutic threshold), and for orthopedic procedures, such as long
bone instrumentation (dotted green line, high therapeutic threshold).
A given bolus of fentanyl only produces clinically discernible analge-
sia from the time it produces an effect site concentration above the
therapeutic threshold concentration for a patient until the time when
the effect site concentration decreases below the therapeutic thresh-
old concentration. If the effect site concentration does not exceed the
toxic threshold for a patient, then it does not produce profound opioid-
induced ventilatory depression. In contrast, if the bolus does produce
an effect site concentration above the toxic threshold concentration, it
will produce profound ventilatory depression that is sustained until the
effect site concentration decreases below the toxic threshold concen-
tration. For example, after superficial surgery, a small dose of fentanyl
(solid black line) will initially produce detectable analgesia approxi-
mately 2 minutes after administration (when it crosses the low thera-
peutic threshold, dashed green line) which will last until approximately
10 minutes after administration (when the concentration decreases
below the low therapeutic threshold, green dashed line). Since the
dose does not produce a concentration above the low toxic threshold
(dashed red line), hypoventilation will not occur after this single bolus.
In contrast, for the same superficial procedure, a larger bolus of fen-
tanyl (solid blue line) will initially produce analgesia less than 1 minute
after administration (when it crosses the low therapeutic threshold,
dashed green line), which will last until approximately 30 minutes after
administration (when the concentration decreases below the low thera-
peutic threshold, green dashed line). Since the dose produces an effect
site concentration above the toxic threshold (dashed red line), it will
produce profound hypoventilation from approximately 2 minutes until
the effect site concentration decreases below the same toxic threshold
at approximately 18 minutes. So, although the larger bolus produces
a quicker onset of action and a longer duration of action, it produces
toxicity for a portion of this time. After orthopedic procedures (dotted
green line for high therapeutic threshold and dotted red line for high
toxic threshold), a small bolus of fentanyl will be subtherapeutic and
ineffective (black solid line) because it does not produce a concentra-
tion above the high therapeutic threshold (dotted green line). In con-
trast, a larger bolus of fentanyl produces clinically discernible analgesia
from approximately 2 through 10 minutes after administration (time
that blue line is above green dotted line).
of drug interactions and specific interactions with drugs used in
anesthesia are essential to safe practice. Indeed, anesthesia pro-
viders often deliberately take advantage of drug interactions. For
example, moderate to high doses of opioid are often utilized to
decrease the amount of volatile anesthetic required to provide
immobility and hemodynamic stability for surgical incision
(e.g., MAC* and MACbar), thereby avoiding the side effects of
higher concentrations of inhaled anesthetics (e.g., vasodilation,
prolonged recovery). In this section, we will examine the major
classes of drug-drug interactions by detailing common examples
encountered in the perioperative period.
Pharmaceutical (Physiochemicaii)
Interactions
In Vitro Interactions
Anesthesia providers often overlook the drug interactions pro- 12
duced by pharmaceutical (physicochemical) properties because
most perioperative drugs are administered intravenously or via
inhalation and therefore have high bioavailability. However, in
vitro drug-drug interactions due to physiochemical properties
of drugs can significantly alter drug bioavailability and produce
unintended toxic byproducts. Basic acid-base chemistry7 can pre-
dict many of the observed in vitro interactions. One classic exam-
ple of a physiochemical drug-drug interaction that alters drug
bioavailability is the formation of insoluble salts that precipitate
when acidic drugs, such as thiopental, and basic drugs, such as
opioids or muscle relaxants, are “mixed,” such as when admin-
istered through IV tubing with an insufficient fluid flow rate.76
Another example is the observation that commercial preparations
of local anesthetic solutions that contain epinephrine have a lower
pH than plain local anesthetic solutions to which epinephrine is
added shordy prior to administration because of the high acid-
ity of the antioxidant stabilizers used in commercial preparations
(i.e., sodium bisulfite or sodium pyrosulfite).77 The unintended
consequence of this commercial formulation is that the local anes-
thetic appears less effective owing to the increased concentration
of the less permeable ionized form of local anesthetic that exists
in acidic environments.
Although physiochemical drug interactions that affect the
bioavailability of drugs are relatively easy to avoid or, at least,
overcome by increasing the drug dose, some physiochemical
interactions can result in unintended toxic compounds. One
chemical agent often overlooked by anesthesia providers is the
soda lime or Baralyme that is used in modern anesthesia machines
to remove carbon dioxide from exhaled gases. Although patients
are not directly administered this agent, the gas that they inhale
from the anesthesia machine often contains the byproducts of
the interaction between the constituents of the exhaled gas and
the carbon dioxide absorbent. While this allows the patient to
receive a “heated and humidified” inhaled gas mixture, if condi-
tions are correct, the halogenated volatile anesthetics can undergo
degradation by the strong base (i.e., sodium and/or potassium
hydroxide) contained in the carbon dioxide absorbent.78 This
chemical reaction led the FDA to recommend that sevoflurane
exposure should not exceed 2 MAC-hours when fresh gas flow
rates of 1 to less than 2 L/min were used, in order to minimize
exposure to the potentially nephrotoxic haloalkene (“compound
A”) formed by dehydrofluorination of sevoflurane by soda lime or
Barolyme.79 Although the effects of compound A on human renal
function are not of great clinical concern, the strong bases in the
carbon dioxide can also degrade the difluoromethyl containing
*MAC: Minimum alveolar concentration is the pseudo-steady-
state end-tidal alveolar concentration at which 50% of patients
do not move in response to surgical incision or do not have an
increase in heart rate or blood pressure in response to surgical
incision (BAR: blocks autonomic responses).
11 Basic Principles of Clinical Pharmacology
halogenated volatile anesthetics (i.e., desflurane and isoflurane)
to carbon monoxide.80 These patient safety concerns led to the
development and the increased use of Amsorb, a carbon diox-
ide adsorbent that contains calcium hydroxide lime in place of
sodium and/or potassium hydroxide, and causes minimal to no
carbon monoxide or compound A formation.81
In Vivo Interactions
13	Whereas many of the in vitro physio chemical interactions can
result in unintended toxicity due to exposure to either sub-
therapeutic drug concentrations or toxic degradation products,
physiochemical interactions have been exploited to develop two
novel approaches to antagonize neuromuscular junction block-
ing agents. The first approach, which was approved for use in
the European Union in 2008 and in the United States in 2016,
is the selective relaxant binding agent, sugammadex. Sugam-
madex is a synthetic cyclodextrin that encapsulates and electro-
statically binds rocuronium. By essentially irreversibly binding
plasma rocuronium, sugammadex acts as a chelator that not only
rapidly decreases the free plasma rocuronium concentration but
also promotes redistribution of rocuronium from the neuromus-
cular junction (extracellular space) to the intravascular space.82
Therefore, if there is an excess of sugammadex molecules rela-
tive to rocuronium molecules, the neuromuscular blockade is
antagonized. Although sugammadex was developed to antago-
nize neuromuscular blockade produced by rocuronium, it is also
able to antagonize profound neuromuscular blockade produced
by the other commonly used steroidal neuromuscular blocking
agents, such as vecuronium and pipecuronium.83,84 However,
sugammadex is unable to antagonize neuromuscular blockade
produced by the benzylisoquinoline neuromuscular blocking
agent, cisatracurium. Molecules from the cucurbit [n]uril family
can encapsulate both the steroidal and benzylisoquinoline fam-
ily of neuromuscular blocking agents in preclinical models and
may ultimately be a more comprehensive solution for antagonism
of neuromuscular blockade via molecular encapsulation.85-87 An
alternative approach to neuromuscular blockade antagonism is to
design a molecule that can be inactivated via nonbiologic routes.
This approach has led to Phase 1 studies of a new class of non-
depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs called the fumarates
(olefinic diester isoquinolinium compounds). These molecules
are rapidly inactivated by the nonenzymatic formation of cyste-
ine adducts when combined with plasma cysteine.88 Therefore,
cysteine administration antagonizes the neuromuscular blockade.
These two novel approaches to drug development could be used
to develop designer drugs that can be readily antagonized via non-
biologic routes, if the important receptor targets for sedation and
amnesia components of general anesthesia are identified.
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Drugs can alter each other’s absorption, distribution, and elimi-
nation. Understanding the basis for alterations in the pharmaco-
kinetics allows anesthesiologists to not only avoid unintentional
supratherapeutic or subtherapeutic concentrations of the periop-
erative medications, but also to strategically employ alterations
in pharmacokinetics to achieve the desired concentration profile.
Absorption (Uptake)
Some drugs can alter the absorption of other drugs, by either
altering the delivery of drug to site of drug absorption (uptake)
or by altering the local blood flow to the site of drug adminis-
tration. Although this type of drug-drug interaction will alter
bioavailability, it should not alter any other pharmacokinetic
parameter. Drugs like ranitidine, which alters gastric pH, and
metoclopramide, which speeds gastric emptying, affect absorp-
tion from the gastrointestinal tract. Vasoconstrictors that decrease
local blood flow and decrease systemic uptake of drug can be
beneficial when added to local anesthetic solutions because they
prolong the duration of action of the local anesthetic at the site of
injection and can decrease the risk of systemic toxicity from rapid
absorption. However, when systemically administered, vasoactive
drugs can decrease blood flow to skin and muscle and decrease
the systemic uptake of drugs given by subcutaneous or intra-
muscular injection. In a similar manner, vasoactive agents can
alter the ventilation-perfusion ratio, thereby altering pulmonary
uptake of volatile anesthetics, despite a constant inspired concen-
tration. Because of the variability produced by vasoactive agents
in drug uptake, careful thought must be given when choosing to
administer drugs via the non-IV route in perioperative patients.
Distribution
Some drugs can alter the systemic distribution of other drugs.
Alterations in drug distribution will change some or all of a phar-
macokinetic model’s volume parameters. It can also alter one
or all of the intercompartmental clearance parameters of a mul-
ticompartmental pharmacokinetic model. There are two main
mechanisms by which drug-drug interactions are purported to
alter drug distribution: (1) changing the volume of tissue avail-
able for drug uptake and (2) changing the amount of drug avail-
able for tissue uptake. Since the drug dose required to achieve a
desired drug concentration is intimately linked to systemic drug
distribution, understanding what common drug-drug interac-
tions produce real alterations in drug distribution can avoid unin-
tentional exposure to subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic drug
concentrations.
Although a drug cannot alter the actual volume of tissue avail- 14
able for drug uptake, changing the exposure of blood to different
tissue beds changes a drug’s apparent tissue volume of distribution.
Therefore, drug-induced alterations of cardiac output and the dis-
tribution of cardiac output to tissues can change the distribution
clearance of other drugs. Once again, vasoactive agents can alter
tissue distribution by altering regional blood flow even if the total
cardiac output is unchanged. Because the change in the plasma
drug concentration produced by a prescribed dosing regimen is
inversely related to the distribution clearance, the drug dose must
be decreased when vasoactive drugs decrease cardiac output or
the distribution of cardiac output; otherwise, the patient will be
exposed to supratherapeutic drug concentrations.89-91 In addi-
tion, the unintended cardiovascular effects of anesthetic drugs,
such as the decrease in cardiac output with increasing doses of
the direct myocardial depressant, halothane, or the direct arterial
dilator, isoflurane, can lead to similar increases in the plasma drug
concentration.92,93
There is an abundance of clinical pharmacology literature
that examines the ability of one drug to displace another drug
from its protein-binding site(s), thereby increasing the concen-
tration of unbound drug in the blood that could cause suprath-
erapeutic concentrations and potential toxicity. When examining
specific pharmacokinetic parameters, an increase in the fraction
of unbound drug in the plasma could theoretically increase the
total apparent volume of distribution (V^), as more molecules
of drug are available for distribution into the tissue. Although
most changes in protein binding will not influence clinical drug
exposure, analysis of the equations governing the steady-state
pharmacokinetics suggests that drugs that are extensively pro-
tein bound, have a high hepatic extraction ratio, and have a
low therapeutic index may be the exception that require dose

244
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
adjustment.94 However, the clinical importance of protein bind-
ing as it pertains to anesthetic drugs is based on several common
misconceptions regarding drug distribution. First, the number of
unoccupied binding sites is several orders of magnitude higher
than the number of molecules of anesthetic drug administered
in clinical practice. Therefore, it is hard to envision a scenario
where a significant amount of displacement could occur. Even if
a drug could displace a significant amount of another drug from
its protein-binding site, the liver has the capacity available to
metabolize this sudden influx of free drug, thereby returning the
free drug concentration to the predisplacement concentrations
(i.e., flow-limited metabolism). Finally, the theoretical argument
supporting the importance of protein binding on highly lipo-
philic drugs ignores the fact that lipophilic drugs not only have
flow-limited elimination clearance, but also flow-limited tissue
distribution. Therefore, the equations supporting the negligible
role of protein binding on flow-limited elimination clearance also
generalize to include flow-limited tissue distribution.94 Indirect
proof of this is provided by the fact that there are no examples
in the literature of drug-drug interactions that produce changes
in protein binding of opioids and hypnotics that are clinically
relevant.95
Metabolism
15 Drugs that alter hepatic blood flow (i.e., vasoactive drugs, vola-
tile anesthetics) can proportionally alter hepatic metabolism of
drugs with flow-limited clearance.89,90-93 In addition, drugs that
inhibit or induce the enzymes that catalyze biotransformation
reactions can affect clearance of other concomitantly adminis-
tered drugs (Table 11-5). The concomitant use of CYP isozyme
inducers can usually be overcome by increasing the administered
dose, especially if an easy measure of biologic activity is available
or the therapeutic concentration range is known. For example,
the anticonvulsant phenytoin shortens the duration of action of
the nondepolarizing neuromuscular junction-blocking agents by
inducing CYP3A4 and thereby increasing drug elimination clear-
ance.96 In contrast, when CYP isozyme inhibition is present, it is

more difficult to adjust the drug dose without achieving suprath-
erapeutic, and possibly toxic drug concentrations, unless a suit-
able rapidly responsive measure of biologic activity is available.
For example, it may be possible to safely administer opioids in
the presence of a drug that inhibits CYP such as the protease
inhibitor ritonavir, because opioids can be titrated in small doses
to clinical effect; however, it is more difficult to titrate warfarin
or glyburide when instituting short-term therapy with a CYP
inhibiting drug such as an antifungal agent. Furthermore, pro-
drugs that require CYP isozyme activity for conversion to active
moieties may be difficult to titrate to adequate clinical effect
if there are other sources of interindividual variability in drug
dose-response. The opioid prodrugs codeine, oxycodone, hydro-
codone, and tramadol all require CYP2D6 for conversion to the
biologically active opioid.95 Because CYP2D6 is highly polymor-
phic, it is difficult to determine whether a patient who is taking
a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 activity (such as selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors) will receive adequate analgesia from these
opioids.
Pharmacodynamic Interactions
Pharmacodynamic interactions fall into two broad classifications.
Drugs can interact either directly or indirectly at the same recep-
tor. For example, opioid antagonists direcdy displace opioids
from opiate receptors. On the other hand, cholinesterase inhibi-
tors indirectly antagonize the effects of neuromuscular blockers
by increasing acetylcholine, which displaces the blocking drug
from nicotinic receptors. Pharmacodynamic interactions can also
occur if two drugs affect a physiologic system at different sites.97,98
For example, |l-opioid receptor-mediated ventilatory depression
can be selectively antagonized by ampakines that potentiate
a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)
receptor-mediated glutamatergic excitation without mitigating
opioid-induced analgesia.99
The synergistic pharmacodynamic interaction between hyp-
notics and opioids each acting at its own receptor, is one of the
most advantangeous to clinical anesthesia practice.100 The phar-
macodynamic interaction between two drugs can be characterized
by utilizing response surface models.101-106 The three-dimensional
models are useful in delineating the concentration pairs of a
hypnotic (e.g., volatile anesthetic, propofol, midazolam) and an
opioid (e.g., remifentanil, alfentanil, fentanyl) that produce ade-
quate anesthesia, while minimizing undesired side effects.107 (See
Response Surface Models, below.)
Serotonin Syndrome
One pharmacodynamic interaction that has become more com- 16
mon with the widespread use of medications that modulate the
serotonergic pathway is the potentially fatal serotonin syndrome
(A NICV 11-1).108,109 High CNS concentrations of serotonin
can produce mental status changes (confusion, hyperactivity,
memory problems), muscle twitching, excessive sweating, shiver-
ing, and fever. Classically, unusually high CNS serotonin levels
have been associated with drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase
(MAOIs), an enzyme responsible for metabolizing serotonin in
the brain. However, serotonin excess has also been associated
with other antidepressant medications, including serotonin reup-
take inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibi-
tors (Table 11-6). The interaction of meperidine with MAOIs
is the most classic drug-drug interaction associated with sero-
tonin syndrome. Other common perioperative medications, such
as methylene blue, which is a potent reversible MAOI, and the
phenylpiperidine series of opioids (i.e, fentanyl and its congeners,
methadone, meperidine, tramadol), which act as weak serotonin

reuptake inhibitors, have been reported to be associated with sero-
tonin toxicity in case reports.109,110-112 Ideally, serotonergic drugs
would be held perioperatively until sufficient CNS drug washout
could occur. However, many SSRIs have long elimination half-
fives that would require greater than 4 weeks’ cessation; in most
cases, the risk of withholding these drugs (worsening depression
or neuropathic pain) are considered to outweight the benefits.
When adequate washout cannot be obtained and a drug such
as methylene blue must be administered, the serotonergic drug
should not reinstated for 24 hours after the last dose of methy-
lene blue.111 Furthermore, when methylene blue or phenylpiperi-
dine opioids must be administered to patients taking serotonergic
psychiatric medications, clinicians should have a high clinical
suspicion for the development of serotonin syndrome. This is
especially important in the perioperative period when other more
common clinical states, such as postoperative delirium or peri-
operative fever, can mimic the symptoms of serotonin toxicity.
Although cyproheptadine, a serotonin receptor antagonist, is the
most common treatment for moderate to severe serotonin toxic-
ity, it is only available as an oral formulation, thereby limiting its
bioavailability in critically ill patients. IV chlorpromazine is an
alternative serotonin receptor antagonist that has been used suc-
cessfully with concomitant supportive care.
Clinical Applications of
Pharmacokinetics and
Pharmacodynamics to
the Administration of
Intravenous Anesthetics
While no new inhaled anesthetics have been synthesized since
the 1960s, IV drugs that act on the CNS continue to be developed.
Anesthesiologists have become accustomed to the exquisite con-
trol of anesthetic blood (and effect site) concentrations afforded
by modern volatile anesthetic agents and their vaporizers, as well
as end-tidal anesthetic gas monitoring. Although pharmacoki-
netic and pharmacodynamic principles and data have contributed
gready to our understanding of the behavior of IV anesthetics,
their primary utility is to determine optimal dosing. In most phar-
macotherapeutic scenarios outside of anesthesia care, the time
scales for onset of drug effect, maintenance, and offset are mea-
sured in days, weeks, or even years. In such cases, global pharma-
cokinetic variables (and one-compartment models) such as total
volume of distribution (Vd), elimination clearance (Cle), and half-
fife (t1/2) are sufficient for calculating dose regimens. However, in
246
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
the operating room and intensive care unit, the temporal toler-
ances for onset and offset of desired drug effects are measured
in minutes.39,40 Consequently, these global variables are insuffi-
cient to describe the details of kinetic behavior of drugs in the
minutes following IV administration. This is particularly true of
lipid-soluble hypnotics and opioids that rapidly and extensively
distribute throughout the various tissues of the body because
distribution processes dominate pharmacokinetic behavior dur-
ing the time frame of most anesthetics. In addition, the therapeu-
tic indices of many IV anesthetic drugs are small and two-tailed
(e.g., an underdose, resulting in awareness, is just as “toxic” as an
overdose). Optimal dosing in these situations requires use of all
the variables of a multicompartmental pharmacokinetic model to
account for drug distribution in blood and other tissues.
It is not easy to predict pharmacokinetic behavior in a multi-
compartmental system by simple examination of the kinetic vari-
ables.10 Computer simulation is required to meaningfully interpret
or accurately devise new dosing regimens. In addition, there are
several pharmacokinetic concepts that are uniquely applicable to
IV administration of drugs with multicompartmental kinetics and
must be taken into account when administering IV infusions.
To achieve similar degrees of control of intravenously admin-
istered anesthetic drug concentrations in blood and in the CNS,
new technologies and software to manage the daunting pharma-
cokinetic principles involved are needed. This section examines
the current state of IV infusion devices and the pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic principles required for precise delivery of
anesthetic agents.
ffiisQ to Steady-State
The drug concentration versus time profile for the rise to steady
state is the mirror image of its elimination profile. In a one-com-
partment model with a decline in concentration versus time that is
monoexponential following a single dose, the rise of drug concen-
tration to the steady-state concentration (Css) is likewise monoex-
ponential during a continuous infusion. That is, in one elimination
half-life, an infusion is halfway to its eventual steady-state con-
centration, in another half-life, it reaches half of what remains
between halfway and steady state (i.e., 75% of the eventual steady
state is reached in two elimination half-lives), and so on for each
half-life increment. The equation describing this behavior is:
Cp(t) = Css[l — e-h<] (11-21)
where Cp(t) = the concentration at time t, k is the rate constant
related to the elimination half-life, and t is the time from the start
of the infusion. This relationship can also be described by:
Cp(n) = CB[1 - (1/2)"] (11-22)
in which C„(n) is the concentration at n half-lives. Equation 11-22
indicates that during a constant infusion, the concentration
reaches 90% of Css after 3.3 half-lives, which is usually deemed
close enough for clinical purposes.
However, for a drug such as propofol, which partitions exten-
sively into pharmacologically inert body tissues (e.g., muscle, gut),
a monoexponential equation, or single-compartment model, is
insufficient to describe the time course of propofol concentrations
in the first minutes and hours after drug administration is initiated.
Instead, a multicomparlmental or multiexponential model must
be used. With such a model, the time course for the plasma drug
concentration to rise toward steady state changes drastically. The
rate of rise toward steady state is determined by the distribution
rate constants to the degree that their respective exponential
terms contribute to the total area under the concentration versus
time curve. Thus, for the three-compartment model describing
the pharmacokinetics of propofol, Equation 11-21 becomes:
Cp(t) - C$$
A+B+G
B
A+ B + G
(l-e-pt)
G
A+B+G
(l-e-v)
(11-23)
(1-£’“*) +
in which t = time; Cp(t) = plasma concentration at time; A = coef-
ficient of the rapid distribution phase and a = hybrid rate constant
of the rapid distribution phase; B - coefficient of the slower dis-
tribution phase and 0 = hybrid rate constant of the slower distri-
bution; and G = coefficient of elimination phase and y = hybrid
rate constant of the elimination phase. A + B + G is the sum of
the coefficients of all the exponential terms. For most lipophilic
anesthetics and opioids, A is typically one order of magnitude
greater than B, and B is in turn an order of magnitude greater
than G. Therefore, distribution-phase kinetics for IV anesthetics
have a much greater influence on the time to reach Css than do
elimination-phase kinetics.67
For example, propofol has an elimination half-life of approxi-
mately 6 hours; using the simple one-compartment rule in Equa-
tion 11-22, it would take 6 hours from the start of a constant
rate infusion to reach even 50% of the eventual steady-state
propofol plasma concentration and 12 hours to reach 75%. In
contrast, with a full three-compartment propofol kinetic model,
Equation 11-23 accurately predicts that 50% of steady state is
reached in less than 30 minutes and 75% will be reached in less
than 4 hours. This example emphasizes the necessity of using
multicompartment models to describe the clinical pharmacoki-
netics of IV anesthetics.
Manual BoHms Infusion
Dosing Schemes
Based on a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model, a stable
steady-state plasma concentration (Cpss) can be maintained by
administering an infusion at a rate (I) that is proportional to the
elimination of drug from the body (C1E):
I = Cp$$xClE (11-24)
However, if the drug was only administered by initiating and
maintaining this infusion, it would take one elimination half-
time to reach 50% of the target plasma concentration and three
times that long to reach 90% of the target plasma concentration.
To decrease the time until the target plasma concentration is
achieved, an initial bolus Goading dose) of drug can be adminis-
tered that would produce the target plasma concentration—
Bolus = Cp SSx Vd ss (11-25)
Although this method is very efficient in achieving and main-
taining the target plasma concentration of a drug that instanta-
neously mixes and equilibrates throughout the tissues of the body
(e.g., drugs modeled with a one-compartment pharmacokinetic
model), utilizing the steady-state elimination clearance and vol-
ume of distribution to calculate the loading dose and maintenance
infusion rate will result in plasma drug concentrations that are
higher throughout the initial distribution phase (Fig. 11-15).
Using Equations 11-24 and 11-25 and Viss = 262 L and ClE =
1.7 L/min (for a 50-year-old man who is 178 cm tall and weighs
70 kg, from Schnider et al.170), the loading dose and infusion rate
of propofol that is needed to achieve a steady-state plasma con-
centration of 5 pg/mL is 1,300 mg (18 mg/kg) and 120 pg/kg/min-
11 Basic Principles of Clinical Pharmacology
Figure 11-15 A computer simulation of the plasma propofol
concentration profile during and after the administration of a single
bolus and infusion scheme calculated using the steady-state, one-
compartment pharmacokinetic parameters (red line) and the BET
scheme from Table 11-7 (blue line) to achieve a plasma concentration
of 5 pg/mL. l/d>ss = 262 L and C/E = 1.7 L/min for a 50-year-old male
who is 178 cm tall and weighs 70 kg.
Obviously, the loading dose of propofol is too high, compared to
clinically utilized doses (1 to 2 mg/kg), while the infusion rate
appears to be clinically reasonable. The erroneous estimate of the
loading dose is due to the fact that the initial bolus of drug is not
instantaneously mixed and equilibrated with the entire volume of
tissue that will eventually take up drug. Therefore, manual dosing
strategies for IV anesthetics need to be modified to account for the
fact that when a bolus of drug is administered, it rapidly mixes
and equilibrates with the blood and only a small volume of tissue
(e.g., the central compartment); it then distributes over time into
other tissues.
To design a manual bolus that more precisely achieves the
desired target plasma concentration, it is necessary to choose a
bolus that is based on the small, initial volume of distribution (Vc).
To maintain the target plasma concentration, a series of infusions
of decreasing rate can be used that match the elimination clear-
ance and compensate for drug loss from the central to the periph-
eral compartments during the initial period of extensive drug
distribution and the second period of moderate drug distribution.
This manual dosing scheme has been termed the BET scheme,
where B is the loading bolus dose, E is the infusion to replace
drug removed by elimination clearance, and T is a continuously
decreasing infusion that compensates for transfer of drug to the
peripheral tissues (i.e., distribution).113 An example of a BET
scheme for propofol to achieve a target plasma concentration of
5 pg/mL is shown in Table 11-7.

netics of Schnider et al. and is plotted on a log-log scale to better delin-

concentration versus time plots, resulting from the various continuous
infusion rates indicated along the right and upper borders (units in
pg/kg/min)-. A horizontal line is placed at the desired target plasma pro-
pofol concentration (3 pg/mL in this case) and vertical lines are placed
at each intersection of a curved concentration-time plot. The vertical
lines indicate the times that the infusion rate should be set to the one
represented by the next intersected curve as one moves from left to
right along the horizontal line drawn at 3 pg/mL. In this example, the
infusion rate would be reduced from 300 pg/kg/min to 275 pg/kg/min
at 2.5 minutes, to 250 pg/kg/min at 3 minutes, to 225 pg/kg/min
at 4.5 minutes, and so on until it is turned to 100 pg/kg/min at
260 minutes.
Pharmacokinetic Simulation Software
One of the many challenges in disseminating pharmacokinetic
information is that the concept of drug disposition is described
in mathematical terms. Historically, bridging the connection
between the mathematical language of pharmacometrics and a
graphical interpretation of drug concentration versus time has
been limited either to clinical pharmacologists with a background
in mathematical modeling, or those with statistical coding skills
and ready access to commercially available pharmacokinetic-
pharmacodynamic modeling software.114 These computational
techniques are not taught in anesthesia training.
Not surprisingly, reported pharmacokinetic parameter esti-
mates can be difficult to interpret and require translation or
denumeration to guide clinical decision making and dosing
recommendations.115 The concept of denumeration of pharma-
cokinetics was described nearly 40 years ago.116 However, only
recently have software tools been introduced that make acces-
sible user-friendly pharmacokinetic simulation, incorporating a
graphical interface.117 These programs allow for the conceptual-
ization of pharmacokinetics by displaying a numerical and graph-
ical interpretation of drug concentration versus time in response
to user input of dose and dose interval.117 There are numerous
simulation programs available. These programs range from free,
open-source web-based tools to commercially available desktop
applications.117,118
Access to user-friendly pharmacokinetic simulation software
is important for teaching clinical pharmacology principles. One
of the sentinel programs designed specifically for the education
and conceptualization of anesthetic pharmacology was created

nearly 40 years ago. This program was created specifically to
simulate inhalational anesthetic uptake and distribution.119
Recendy, Steven Shafer developed the StanpumpR program—an
R language successor to Stanpump—which simulates plasma
and effect site anesthetic concentrations. StanpumpR, like its
precursor, is an open-source program with embedded pharmaco-
kinetic-pharmacodynamic models of a large cache of commonly
administered anesthetic drugs. However, unlike Stanpump,
StanpumpR does not support drug delivery. Rather, StanpumpR
serves as a web-based pharmacokinetic simulator designed to
support teaching and research. The simulations are based on the
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models published in peer-
reviewed literature. StanpumpR is different from many other sim-
ulation programs in that it is free, widely available, and provides
a user-friendly graphical interface in which drug inputs can be
entered and computed plasma and effect-site concentration ver-
sus time curves will be displayed (Fig. 11-17). No prior expertise
in modeling or statistical coding is required.
Context-Sensitive Decrement Time
17 During an infusion, drug is taken up by the inert, peripheral tis-
sues.19 Once drug delivery is terminated, recovery occurs when
the effect site concentration decreases below a threshold concen-
tration for producing a pharmacologic effect (e.g., MACawake —
the concentration where 50% of patients follow commands).67,106
Although the rate of elimination of the drug from the body can
give some indication for the time required to reach a subtherapeu-
tic effect, site, drug concentration, and distribution to and from the
peripheral tissues also contribute to the time course of decreasing
drug concentrations of the central and the effect site. For drugs
with multicompartmental kinetics, the elimination half-life will
always overestimate the time to recovery from anesthetic drugs.
The context-sensitive half-time is defined as the time required for
the plasma drug concentration to decrease by 50%, where the
context is the duration of the infusion.120 The context-sensitive
half-time for the common synthetic opioids fentanyl, alfentanil,
sufentanil, and remifentanil are illustrated in Figure 11-18.
The context-sensitive half-time is not a pharmacokinetic
parameter per se. It is calculated by simulating a TCI of a par-
ticular length (the length is the context) and then observing the
time required for the plasma concentration to reach one-half of
the target concentration from the time the infusion is terminated.
As the length of the infusion increases, the value of the half-time
increases and will eventually asymptotically approach a maxi-
mum half-time at steady state. In general, for multicompartmental
pharmacokinetic models, the half-time will always be less than
the elimination half-life.
When an infusion is terminated at steady state, input into the
system’s central compartment is lost and net transfer of drug is
no longer zero. Instead, net drug distribution immediately begins
moving toward the central compartment from the peripheral
Figure 11-18 The context-sensitive plasma half-time for fentanyl,
alfentanil, sufentanil, and remifentanil.
11 Basic Principles of Clinical Pharmacology
compartments rather than away, as was the case during infu-
sion, and elimination from the central compartment continues
unabated by the infusion’s input. Plasma or central compartment
concentrations will fall relatively rapidly compared to the elimi-
nation half-life, until set concentration ratios of centrabfast and
centrahslow are achieved. These ratios with higher peripheral
compartment drug concentrations will achieve the net drug dis-
tribution flux into the central compartment that will balance the
elimination flux to create a constant elimination rate.
During the elimination phase, the multicompartmental system
behaves kinetically as a single compartment, but only does so
because there are (fixed) drug concentration ratios among the
compartments. With a short infusion, the peripheral compart-
ment drug concentrations will have only achieved low drug con-
centrations, and the plasma drug concentration will have to fall
quite far to reach the centrakperipheral drug concentration ratios
needed to enter the constant elimination phase. Thus, the half-
time is less with shorter infusion contexts. After a very long infu-
sion with peripheral compartment drug concentrations reaching
higher drug concentrations as they approach their steady state,
plasma drug concentrations will not need to fall as much to reach
the concentration ratios required for the elimination phase, and
the rate of plasma drug decline will begin approaching the elimi-
nation half-life sooner, resulting in longer half-times.
The concept of context-sensitive half-times has limitations.10-21
First, it is not a kinetic parameter; it only describes a specific
simulation event. This means it cannot be extrapolated backward
or, more importantly, forward to lesser or greater drug concen-
tration decrements, as is possible with true kinetic parameters.
Second, it cannot be directly calculated from other kinetic param-
eters. Rather, a model of the specific drug pharmacokinetics is
programmed into a simulation with a set drug infusion regimen.
Third, the most relevant concentration decrease may not be one-
half. It could be less than one-half or, as is more likely in practice,
more than one-half. Therefore, simulating both the specific infu-
sion context as well as the required percentage decrease from the
target concentration should be done to get the best estimate of
when a drug’s effect will reach the clinically desired end point.
Although a 50% decrease in plasma concentration is an appeal-
ing and comprehensible parameter, larger or smaller decreases
in plasma concentrations may be required for recovery from
the drug. Simulations show that the times for different percent
decreases in plasma concentration are not linear.10-21 Therefore,
if a 25% or 75% decrease in plasma concentration is required,
simulations must be performed to calculate the context-sensitive
25% decrement time or context-sensitive 75% decrement time
(Fig. 11-19). In addition, if the concentration of interest is the
effect site concentration rather than the plasma concentration,

gence (solid black line and right y-axis) after
propofol bolus (150 mg) and 4-hour infu-

(i.e., reaching an effect site concentration

simulations can be performed to calculate the context-sensitive
effect site decrement time. Finally, if a constant plasma or effect-
site concentration is not maintained throughout the delivery
of the drug (which is typically the case with manual bolus and
infusion schemes), the context-sensitive decrement times are
guidelines of recovery rather than an absolute prediction of the
decay in drug concentration. If precise drug administration data
are known, it is possible to compute the context-sensitive decre-
ment time for the individual situation or context. Even though
the context-sensitive decrement times are limited, this concept
has changed the way that IV anesthetics are described and has
helped in the development of tools to more accurately and safely
administer IV anesthetics.
Cbntext-Sens/f/ve Time to
Elimination half-life describes the time for half of the drug remain-
ing in the body at any time after pseudoequilibration with all tis-
sues (i.e., peripheral compartments) to be irreversibly eliminated.
Context-sensitive half-time refers to the time necessary for a 50%
decrement of drug concentration (generally from the plasma or
effect-site compartments) after immediate discontinuation of
drug administration and in the context of varying durations of
drug administration. Half-life and half-time are identical for drugs
whose kinetics are described by a one-compartmental model.
However, for IV and inhalational drug delivery, characterization
of pharmacokinetic behavior requires models that account for
distribution to both well-perfused and poorly perfused tissues; as
a result, there is always a discrepancy between context-sensitive
half-time and elimination half-life. As an example, Shafer and
Varvel demonstrated that the usual clinical context-sensitive
half-time of alfentanil is approximately double that of sufentanil,
despite the latter’s elimination half-life being nearly five times that
of alfentanil.121
Both elimination half-life and context-sensitive half-time are
useful pharmacokinetic parameters. Unfortunately, the clini-
cal significance of each parameter may be difficult to interpret,
and they both are often mistaken for the time to recovery from
drug effect. In fact, time to recovery has been determined to be a
function of both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic prop-
erties.122 Combining context sensitivity with threshold recovery
concentrations allows for calculation of a context-sensitive time
to recovery.123 Where context-sensitive decrement times simulate
the time for a certain percent decrement in concentration (e.g.,
half-time), context-sensitive recovery times simulate the time to
reach a particular threshold concentration after terminating a
drug infusion, resulting in dissipation of drug effect. Newer sim-
ulation software can simulate context-sensitive time to recovery
(Fig. 11-20).
Soft Pharmacology sm&l Anesthesiology
Accumulation of drug in well-perfused but inactive tissue beds (i.e.,
skeletal muscle) results in drug depots within tissues. When the
arterial concentration of drug is less than the tissue concentration
of drug in any of these depots, the drug redistributes from the tis-
sue back into the plasma, thereby slowing the rate of decline of the
plasma concentration. One strategy that has been used to limit tissue
uptake of drug is to design active compounds that are rapidly metab-
olized by plasma and/or tissue enzymes into inactive metabolites—
so-called soft drugs.124,125 Remifentanil is the prototypic soft drug,
and its unique pharmacokinetic fingerprint (i.e., context-insensitive
decrement times) resulted in development of this synthetic fentanyl
analog instead of other viable candidates.66,126
With the success of remifentanil, investigators have attempted
to produce hypnotics with context-insensitive decrement times
(Fig. 11-21). This approach has resulted in a new benzodiaz-
epine, several etomidate analogs, and a novel hypnotic that
inhibits GABAa receptors.127-130 Remimazolam is a new benzo-
diazepine that is metabolized by plasma and tissue esterases. It
has a chemical structure nearly identical to its parent compound
midazolam with the addition of an ester linkage. The drug was
recently approved by the FDA for procedural sedation, and
for use in induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in
Japan.131-135 The etomidate analogs are not yet in Phase I stud-
ies. However, preclinical data have resulted in selection of an
etomidate analog that has context-insensitive decrement times
as well as limited adrenal suppression.134-142 Further studies
will determine if these analogs have a safer profile compared to
etomidate in the setting of cerebral ischemia.143-145 Phase I stud-
ies of the GABAa inhibitor AZD-3043 have shown rapid onset,
rapidly titratable hypnosis with a context-insensitive recovery
profile.130,146-148
Target-Controlled Infusions
Prior to an anesthetic, it is possible to perform the calculations
above and derive a BET scheme targeted to a predetermined
plasma or effect-site concentration. However, in the operating
room, once the anesthetic has commenced, without the help of a

with the CSHTs more than 30 minutes (i.e., dexmedetomidine, fen-

which are almost context insensitive.

Figure 11-23 This is a simulation of a target-controlled infu-
sion (TCI) in which the effect site concentration (Ce) is targeted
at 5 pg/mL. The orange line represents the predicted plasma propo-
fol concentration (Cp) that results from a bolus dose, given at time
t = 0, that is predicted to purposely overshoot the plasma propofol
concentration target until time t = Tmax (1.6 minutes). At Tmax pseudo-
equilibration between the effect site and the plasma occurs and both
concentrations are then predicted to be the same until the target is
changed. Note that the effect site attains the target in less than half the
time with effect site targeting compared to the plasma concentration
targeting seen in Figure 11-22.
computer, software, and possibly an assistant, it is laborious and
difficult to make calculations to determine how to adjust an infu-
sion or to bolus a drug in order to manipulate the target plasma
concentration.149 By linking a computer with the appropriate
pharmacokinetic model to an infusion pump, it is possible for
the physician to enter the desired target plasma concentration of
a drug, and for the computer to nearly instantaneously calculate
the appropriate infusion scheme to quickly achieve this target.150
Because drug accumulates at various rates among the tissues and
organs in the body, the computer continually calculates the cur-
rent drug concentration and adjusts the infusion pump in order
to account for the current status of drug uptake, distribution, and
elimination. In this way, the computer-driven BET scheme can in
fact control the infusion pump to achieve a steady target concen-
tration (Fig. 11-22).
Figure 11 -22 This is a simulation of a target-controlled infusion
(TCI) in which the plasma concentration is targeted at 5 pg/mL.
The blue line represents the predicted plasma propofol concentration
of 5 pg/mL, which in theory is attained at time t = 0 and is then main-
tained by a variable rate infusion. The red line is the predicted effect site
concentration under the conditions of a constant pseudo-steady-state
plasma concentration. Note that 95% of the target concentration is
reached in the effect site at approximately 4 minutes.
The success of this approach is influenced by the extent to
which the drug pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parame-
ters programmed into the computer match those of the particular
patient on whom the model is being applied. While this same lim-
itation applies to the more rudimentary (non-TCI) dosing done
routinely in every clinical setting, we must examine the special
ramifications of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model mis-
specification with TCI in any discussion of its future importance
in the clinical setting.
The mathematical principles governing TCI are actually quite
simple. For a computer-control pump to produce and maintain a
plasma drug concentration, it must first administer a dose equal
to the product of the central compartment, Vj, and the target
concentration (Fig. 11-23). Then for each moment after that,
the amount of drug to be administered into the central compart-
ment to maintain the target concentration is equal to drug elimi-
nated from the central compartment plus drug distributed from
the central compartment to peripheral compartments minus drug
returning to the central compartment from peripheral compart-
ments. The software keeps track of the estimated drug in each
compartment over time and applies the rate constants for inter-
compartmental drug transfer from the pharmacokinetic model
to these amounts to determine drug movement at any given
time. It then matches the estimated concentrations to the target
concentration at any time to determine the amount of drug that
should be infused. The software can also predict future concen-
trations, usually with the assumption that the infusion will be
stopped so that emergence from anesthesia or the dissipation of
drug effect will occur optimally according to the context-sensitive
decrement time.
There is a delay or hysteresis between the attainment of a
drug concentration in the plasma and the production of a drug
effect, and it is advantageous to have the mathematics of this delay
incorporated into TCI. By adding the kinetics of the effect site,
it is possible to target effect-site concentrations as would be in
keeping with the principle of working as closely to the relevant
concentration-effect relationship as possible. A dose scheme that
targets concentrations in a compartment remote from the central
Section 2 Basic Science and Fundamentals
compartment (i.e., the effect site) has no closed-form solution for
calculating the infusion rate(s) needed. Instead, the solution is
solved numerically and some additional concepts must be con-
sidered, namely the time to peak effect, Tmax, and the volume of
distribution at peak effect, VDPE. These are discussed later. In prin-
ciple, targeting the effect site necessitates producing an overshoot
in plasma drug concentrations during induction and for subse-
quent target increases. This is similar in concept to overpres-
surizing inhaled anesthetic concentrations to achieve a targeted
end-tidal concentration. However, unlike the inspiratory limb
of an anesthesia circuit, the plasma compartment concentration
appears more closely linked to cardiovascular drug effects; as a
result, large overshoots in plasma drug concentration may pro-
duce unwanted side effects.
The performance of TCI is influenced by the pharmacoki-
netic model chosen. Most modem TCI models, whether they
target the plasma or the effect site, seem to be similar in perfor-
mance, they all produce overshoot for 10 to 20 minutes when
increasing the target concentration.37 This is because the dose
adjustments made are based on calculations that utilize a cen-
tral compartment that ignores the complexity of intravascular
mixing, thereby overestimating the central compartment’s true
volume (Vc), the rate of transfer to the fast peripheral tissue
(C1F), and the size of the peripheral tissue compartment (VF)
(Fig. 11-24). The performance of TCI is also influenced by the
variance between pharmacokinetic parameters determined from
group or population studies and the individual patient. Median
absolute performance errors for fentanyl,151 alfentanil,152 sufen-
tanil,153 midazolam,154'155 and propofol1215'156 are in the range of
±30% when literature values for pharmacokinetic parameters are
used to drive the TCI device; error rates fall to approximately
±7% when the average kinetics of the test subjects themselves

components of the traditional three-compartment pharmacokinetic
models on the prolonged discrepancy (overshoot) between predicted
and targeted concentrations with target-controlled infusions. The error
resulting from elimination clearance was negligible and therefore not
illustrated. Notice that the loading dose (based on Vc) produces a large
amount of error in the initial minutes; however, from 1 to 20 minutes,
the deviation from the target concentration is largely due to the overes-
timation of C/P The equations listed are for the respective BET infusions
of the TCI system. (Reprinted with permission from Avram MJ, Krejcie

are used.152 Divergence (the percentage change of the absolute
performance error) is generally quite low (approximately 1%)
when target concentrations remain relatively stable, but increases
to nearly 20% when concentration steps are as frequent as every
12	minutes.37,156 These data suggest that while a considerable
error may exist (±30%) between the targeted drug concentra-
tion and the one actually achieved in a patient, the concentration
attained will not vary much over time. Thus, incremental adjust-
ments in the target should result in incremental and stable new
concentrations in the patient as long as the incremental adjust-
ments are not too frequent.
The introduction of the concept of TCI, was first described by 18
Schwilden et al. in early 1980s157 Other software systems were
developed in North America by groups at Stanford University
and Duke University. By the late 1990s, a commercially available
TCI system for propofol (Diprifusor) was introduced. This greatly
increased both anesthesiologists’ interest in this mode of delivery
and their understanding of the concentration-effect relationships
for hypnotics and opioids. In most of the world, devices for deliv-
ering propofol by TCI are commercially available from at least
three companies (Graseby, Alaris, and Fresenius) with similar
performance parameters.158 In the United States, there are still no
FDA-approved devices. For investigational purposes, Stanpump
(developed by Steve Shafer at Stanford University) can be inter-
faced via an RS232 port to an infusion pump. Stanpump currently
provides pharmacokinetic parameters for 19 different drugs but
has the ability to accept any kinetic model for any drug provided
by the user. RugLoop is TCI software (developed by Michel Struys
of Ghent University) similar to STANPUMP but operates in Win-
dows rather than DOS and is capable of controlling multiple drug
infusions simultaneously. (Information regarding RugLoop is
available at http://www.demed.be/index.html.)
While the pharmacologic principle of relating a concentration
rather than a dose is scientifically sound, only a few limited stud-
ies have actually compared manual infusion control versus TCI.
Some have shown better control and a more predictable emergence
with TCI,158,159 whereas others have shown no advantage.160,161
TCI principles continue to be developed beyond the scope of
IV anesthesia techniques. TCI has been used to provide postop-
erative analgesia with alfentanil.162,163 In this system, a desired
target plasma alfentanil concentration was set in the range of
40 to 100 ng/mL. Demand by the patient automatically increased
the target level by 5 ng/mL. Lack of a demand caused the system
to gradually reduce the targeted level. The quality of analgesia was
judged to be superior to standard morphine patient-controlled
analgesia.
Similarly, TCI has been used to provide patient-controlled
sedation with propofol.164,165 The TCI was set to 1 pg/mL and
a demand by the patient incrementally increased the level by
0.2 Hg/mL. As with the TCI analgesia system, the lack of a demand
caused the system to gradually reduce the targeted plasma propo-
fol concentration. The timing and increment of the decrease were
adjusted by the clinician. Over 90% of patients were satisfied with
this method of sedation.
Hme fo Maximum Effect
Concentration (Tmax)
Earlier in this chapter, the delay between attaining a plasma
concentration and an effect-site concentration was described
(Fig. 11-12), This delay, or hysteresis, is presumed to be a result
of transfer of drug between the plasma compartment, Vc, and an
effect compartment, Ve, as well as the time required for a cellular
response. By simultaneously modeling the plasma drug concen-
tration versus time data (pharmacokinetics) and the measured
11 Basic Principles of Clinical Pharmacology
drug effect (pharmacodynamics), an estimate of the drug transfer
rate constant, ke0, between plasma and the putative effect site can
be estimated.65 However, estimates of ke0, like all rate constants,
are model specific.166,167 That is, ke0 cannot be transported from
one set of kinetic parameters determined in one specific phar-
macokinetic-pharmacodynamic study to any other set of phar-
macokinetic parameters. Likewise, it is not valid to compare
estimates of ke0 among studies of the same drug or across different
drugs and, therefore, one should not be surprised that reported
values for ke0 for the same drug vary markedly in the literature.
The model-independent parameter that characterizes the delay
between the plasma and effect site is the time to maximal effect,
or Tmax.16' Accordingly, if the Tmax and the pharmacokinetics for a
drug are known from independent studies, a ke0 can be estimated
by numeric techniques for the independent kinetic set that would
produce the known effect site Tmax.
The concept of a transportable, model-independent parameter
that characterizes the kinetics of the effect site is important for
robust effect site-targeted, computer-controlled infusions. This is
because there are many more pharmacokinetic studies character-
izing a wider variety of patient types and groups in the literature
than there are complete pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic
studies. By making the generally valid assumption that interin-
dividual differences are small in a drug’s rate of effect site equili-
bration, it is possible with a known Tmax to estimate effect site
kinetics for a drug across a wide variety of patient groups where
only the pharmacokinetics are known. This cannot be done in a
valid manner using kE0 or tVz Ke0 alone.166,167
l/o/ume of Distribution) at Peak
Effect (VDPE)
While the plasma concentration can be brought rapidly to the
targeted drug concentration by administering a bolus dose
to the central compartment (C x Vc) and then held there by a
computer-controlled infusion (Fig. 11-22), the time for the effect
site to reach the target concentration will be much longer than
Tmax (4 minutes for the propofol effect site concentration to reach
95% of that targeted). It is possible to calculate a bolus dose that
will attain the estimated effect site concentration at Tmax without
overshoot at the effect site. However, plasma drug concentration
will be overshot (Fig. 11-21). Calculating this bolus dose is done
using the concept that drug distributes into an expanding volume
that starts at Vc and approaches Vp (the apparent volume of dis-
tribution during the elimination phase) over time and combining
that information with the concept of Tmax.168,169
Volume of distribution over time is calculated by dividing the
total amount of drug remaining in the body by the plasma drug
concentration at each time, t. The time-dependent volume at the
time of peak effect (or Tmax) is VDPE. The product of the targeted
effect site concentration and VDPE plus the amount lost to elimi-
nation in the time to Tmax becomes the proper bolus dose that
will attain the target concentration at the effect site as rapidly as
possible without overshoot. In practical terms, this bolus is given
at time t = 0, after which the infusion stops until time t = Tmax.
It then resumes infusing drug in its normal “stop loss” manner.
Some software programs for controlling TCIs include this
concept in their algorithms. Figure 11-16 illustrates an isocon-
centration nomogram for propofol using the pharmacokinetic-
pharmacodynamic parameters described in Schnider et al.170; in
a 70-kg man, this model predicts a Tmax of 1.6 minutes, a VDPE
of 16.62 L, and an elimination loss of 23.8% of the dose over
1.6 minutes. Thus, the proper propofol bolus for a targeted effect
site concentration of 5 pg/mLis 109 mg. The computer-controlled
infusion pump will deliver this dose as rapidly as possible and
then begin a targeted infusion for 5 pg/mL at t = 1.6 minutes
(Fig. 11-23).
Fron t-End Pharmacokinetics
Classic PK-PD models make the simplifying assumption that there 19
is instantaneous and complete mixing of drug in the intravascular
space—a mathematical construct that disregards the physiology
that drives drug disposition.171-173 Therefore, classic PK mod-
els inaccurately describe the initial/central distribution volume
(Vc); as a result, they incorrectly estimate intercompartmental
clearances and are unable to characterize cardiac output and its
distribution.37,40,89,171,173-176 Misspecification of Vc also results in
misspecification of the effect site kinetics and compensates by
overestimating interindividual PD variability.37,173,176 Physiologi-
cally based PK-PD models that can accurately estimate distribu-
tion volumes and clearances result in more realistic estimates
of PD variability (Fig. 11-25).176 Another source of PK and PD
variability is cardiac output and its distribution.89,173,174,176,177 Car-
diac output and its distribution influences PK by modifying the
distribution of drug to tissue compartments. In addition, cardiac
output influences PD by changing the blood-effect site equilibra-
tion rate (Fig. 11-26).176 Because they cannot characterize cardiac
output and its distribution, classic PK-PD models will be unable
to identify the changes in cardiac output and its distribution that
are the result of alterations in physiology related to sex, age, body
composition, or pathologic processes.178,179 Therefore, classic
PK-PD models will not identify factors that solely alter cardiac
output and its distribution as a source of PK variability and will
overestimate the true PD.37,176,180,181
The term front-end pharmacokinetics refers to the intravascular
mixing, pulmonary uptake, and recirculation events that occur in
the first few minutes during and after IV drug administration.40
These kinetic events and the drug concentration versus time pro-
file that results are important because the peak effect of rapidly
Figure 11-25 The misestimation of the central distribution volume
(Vc) by a traditional compartmental PK-PD model results in more inter-
individual variability in pharmacodynamic estimates than pharmaco-
dynamic estimates from a high-resolution, recirculatory PK-PD model.
This figure uses Monte Carlo simulation of the effect site concentra-
tion-pharmacologic effect relationships to demonstrate the interin-
dividual variability from a traditional compartmental PK-PD model
(2 COMP, blue dashed lines') and a high-resolution recirculatory PK-PD
model (RECIRC, black solid lines'). (Adapted with permission from the
rocuronium data of Kuipers JA, Boer F, Olofsen E, et al. Recirculatory

Basic Science and Fundamentals
Figure 11-26 The effects of cardiac output on the blood-effect-site
equilibration rate (ke0) when the PK-PD model is a high-resolution
"recirculatory" model (black circles) versus a traditional compartmental
model (triangles). While the traditional model has a moderate corre-
lation between measured cardiac output and ke0 and significant sys-
tematic error (grey line), the high-resolution recirculatory model has a
very strong correlation between measured cardiac output and ke0 (black
line). Therefore, for lipophilic drugs with flow-limited tissue distribution
(i.e., opioids, hypnotics, etc.), a high-resolution PK-PD model provides
a physiologic basis for transfer of drug from the blood to the effect
site. In addition, these high-resolution PK-PD models can quantitate the
effects of physiologic perturbations on the PK and PD of these drugs
more accurately than the traditional compartmental models. (Adapted
with permission from the rocuronium data of Kuipers JA, Boer F, Olof-
sen E, et al. Recirculatory pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of

acting drugs occurs during this temporal window.39,176,182,183
Although it has been suggested that front-end pharmacokinetics
be used to guide drug dosing,37 current TCI does not incorporate
front-end kinetics into the models from which drug infusion rates
are calculated. As described above, not doing so introduces fur-
ther error.
TCI relies on pharmacokinetic models that are based on the
simplifying assumption of instantaneous and complete mixing
within Vc. However, the determination of Vc is routinely overes-
timated in most pharmacokinetic studies. When used to calculate
TCI infusion rates, overestimation of Vc results in plasma drug
concentrations that overshoot the desired target concentration,
especially in the first few minutes after beginning the infusion.
Furthermore, correct description of drug distribution to tissues is
dependent on an accurate Vc estimate, so inaccuracies caused by
not taking front-end pharmacokinetics into account may be per-
sistent and result in undershoot as well as overshoot. Simulation
indicates that pharmacokinetic parameters derived from stud-
ies in which the drug is administered in a short (approximately
2 minutes) infusion better estimate Vc and tissue-distribution
kinetics than those administered in a rapid IV bolus infusion.37,38
When the latter drug administration method is used, full char-
acterization of the front-end recirculatory pharmacokinetics is
required to obtain valid estimates of Vc for use in TCI.37,38
Closed-Loop Infusions
When a valid and nearly continuous measure of drug effect is
available, drug deliver)' can be automatically titrated by feed-
back control. Such systems have been used experimentally for
control of blood pressure,18'1 oxygen delivery,185 blood glucose,186
neuromuscular blockade,187 and depth of anesthesia.188-194 A tar-
get value for the desired effect measure (the output of the system)
is selected and the rate of drug delivery (the input into the sys-
tem) is dependent on whether the effect measure is above, below,
or at the target value. Thus, the output feeds back and controls the
input. Standard controllers (referred to as proportional-integral-
derivative [P1D] controllers) adjust drug delivery based on both
the integral, or magnitude, of the deviation from target and the
rate of deviation, or the derivative.
Under a range of responses, standard PID controllers work
quite well. However, they have been shown to develop unstable
characteristics in situations where the output may vary rapidly
and widely. Schwilden et al.190 proposed a controller in which the
output (measured response) controls not only the input (drug
infusion rate), but also the pharmacokinetic model driving the
infusion rate. This is known as a model-driven or adaptive closed-
loop system. Such a system has performed well in clinical trials,189
and in a simulation of extreme conditions, it was demonstrated to
outperform a standard PID controller.192
Closed-loop systems for anesthesia are the most difficult to
design and implement because the precise definition of “anesthesia”
remains elusive, as does a robust monitor for “anesthetic depth.”106
Because modification of consciousness must accompany anesthe-
sia, processed electroencephalogram (EEG) parameters that corre-
late with level of consciousness, such as the bispectral index (BIS),
electroencephalographic entropy, and auditory evoked potentials,
make it possible to undertake closed-loop control of anesthesia.19’
There is keen interest in further developing these tools to make
them more reliable, because advances in pharmacokinetic model-
ing, including the effect compartment, the implementation of such
models into drug delivery systems, and the creation of adaptive
controllers based on these models, has made routine closed-loop
delivery of anesthesia imaginable.188 Over the past 10 years, clini-
cal trials investigating closed-loop delivery of propofol or propofol
and remifentanil have demonstrated superior efficiency in drug
delivery and emergence from anesthesia with closed-loop devices
compared to manual titration by experienced anesthesia provid-
ers.196-201 So far, it has been difficult to bring a true closed-loop
system to market in medical applications due to regulatory agency
hurdles. From a regulatory point of view, an open-loop TCI system
is much easier to attain and offers many of the benefits of actual
closed-loop systems. Unless there is a regulatory or design “break-
through,” closed-loop systems for anesthesia will likely remain in
the theoretical and experimental realms.202,205
Response Sorfec® Models
©f Drug-Drug Interactions
During the course of an operation, the level of anesthetic drug
administered is adjusted to ensure amnesia to ongoing events,
provide immobility to noxious stimulation, and blunt the sym-
pathetic response to painful stimuli. Although it is possible to
achieve an adequate anesthetic state with a high dose of a sed-
ative-hypnotic alone (i.e., a volatile anesthetic or propofol), the
effect site drug concentration necessary is often associated with
excessive hemodynamic depression,98 and a deeper than necessary
plane of hypnosis that may be associated with longstanding mor-
bidity or mortality.204,205 Therefore, to limit side effects, an opi-
oid and a sedative-hypnotic are administered together. Although
the administration of two volatile anesthetics or a volatile anes-
thetic and propofol produce a net-additive effect, the combination
of an opioid and a sedative-hypnotic are synergistic for most phar-
macologic effects. By understanding the interactions between the
opioids and the sedative-hypnotics, it is possible to select target
concentration pairs of the two drugs that produce the desired

response to a 5-second, 50-mA tetanic stimulation in volunteers). Each
curve represen ts the concentration-effect relation for sevoflurane with
a fixed effect site concentration of remifentanil. The leftward shift in the
curves indicates that remifentanil decreases the amount of sevoflurane
needed to produce adequate analgesia. The changes in the slopes of the
concentration-response curves indicate that there is significant pharma-
codynamic synergy between sevoflurane-remifentanil. Also note that
there is a ceiling effect to this pharmacodynamic interaction—the mag-
nitude of the leftward shift decreases as the remifentanil concentra-
tion increases. (Adapted with permission from Manyam SC, Gupta DK,

clinical effect while minimizing unwanted side effects associated
with higher concentrations of either drug.
Studies designed to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interac-
tions between an opioid and a sedative-hypnotic have tradition-
ally focused on the effects of adding one or two fixed doses or
concentrations of the opioid to several defined concentrations or
doses of the sedative-hypnotic.97,98,206-213 Graphic demonstrations
of these interaction data are most commonly performed by dem-
onstrating a shift of parallel dose-response curves (Fig. 11-27).
An alternative mathematical model is the isobologram—iso-effect
curves that show dose combinations that result in equal effect
(Fig. 11-28). Isobolographic analysis has the additional benefit of
characterizing the interaction between the two drugs as additive,
antagonistic, or synergistic (Fig. 11-29), whereas shifts of dose-
response curves require more complex concentrations to deter-
mine if the interaction demonstrated by a leftward shift in the
curve is more than additive.
An alternative mathematical model that can fully character-
ize the complete spectrum of interaction between two drugs for
all possible concentrations and effects is the response surface
model.102,105 The surface morphology of a response surface not
only demonstrates whether the interaction is additive, synergistic,
or antagonistic, but the model itself can quantitatively describe
the degree of interaction between the two drugs. Furthermore,
isobolograms can be derived from the projection of the response
surface onto the appropriate horizontal effect plane (Fig. 11-30),
and concentration—response curves can be derived from taking a
vertical slice through a response surface in the plane perpendicular
to the fixed-opioid concentration of interest (Fig. 11-30).102,103,106
Therefore, response surface models can be viewed as general-
izations of the traditional pharmacodynamic methods of analy-
sis. The major limitation of response surface models is that they

require a large number of pharmacodynamic measurements across
all possible concentration pairings to accurately characterize the
entire surface.214 This is most efficiendy done in the laboratory
setting utilizing volunteers who can be exposed to subtherapeutic
and supratherapeutic drug concentration pairs. However, because
response surface models characterize the drug concentration pairs
that provide adequate anesthesia and also adequate recovery from
anesthesia, these models provide information that is not normally
available from studies that generate an isobologram from surgical
patients.
Isobolograms and response surface models clearly dem- 20
onstrate that there are multiple target concentration pairs of
an opioid and a sedative-hypnotic that can provide adequate
anesthesia—a 95% probability of no hemodynamic response to a
noxious stimulus and 95% probability of clinically adequate seda-

As the duration of anesthesia increases, a minimum sevoflurane target
concentration of 0.75 vol% is reached. (Adapted with permission from

models with pharmacokinetic models allows computer simula-
tions to be performed to identify the target concentration pair of
the opioid and the sedative-hypnotic that produces an adequate
anesthetic and yet optimizes one or more pharmacodynamic end
points, such as the speed of awakening from anesthesia, drug-
induced respiratory depression, or drug acquisition costs.100,104
For sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthetics, these types of PK-PD
simulations demonstrate the benefit of minimizing the adminis-
tered dose of even the low solubility volatile anesthetic sevoflu-
rane to near 0.5 MAC to take advantage of the pharmacokinetic
efficiency of remifentanil, especially as the duration of anesthesia
increases (Fig. 11-31 and Table 11-8).104 These response surface
models can accurately predict loss of responsiveness and loss of
response to painful stimuli as well as emergence from anesthesia
and the time at which a patient will require analgesia in the recov-

Conclusion
Since World War II, we have moved from describing anesthetics by
a dose-response relationship to the development of sophisticated
models that characterize the synergistic interaction between seda-
tive-hypnotics and opioids. In addition, technology is now available
to accurately administer a drug to achieve a desired concentration
at the drug effect site. The rational selection of drug target concen-
trations required to achieve adequate anesthesia while minimizing
side effects and the methods by which to efficiently achieve those
concentration targets requires a solid understanding of the clinical
pharmacology of anesthetics. As new drugs enter the anesthetic
armamentarium, careful characterization of their pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic properties will allow them to be safely and
appropriately utilized as part of a balanced anesthetic.106
