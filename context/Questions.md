**Section 1: Introduction and Overview**

A) Alcohol and opium only

B) Mandrake leaves, black nightshade, and poppies, containing varying amounts of morphine and scopolamine

C) A mixture of ether and chloroform applied to a sponge

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The section "Early Analgesics and Soporifics" states that the soporific sponge was created by boiling mandrake leaves, black nightshade, poppies, and other herbs. It further clarifies that, when prepared as indicated, the sponge generally contained morphine and scopolamine.

**2. A CRNA student is researching the history of patient safety in anesthesia. According to the text, which factor was a primary catalyst for the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) establishing a standing committee on Patient Safety and Risk Management in 1984?**

**Section 1: Introduction and Overview**

A) The development of new military anesthesia techniques during wartime

B) A government mandate requiring the formation of safety committees in all medical specialties

C) Rapidly changing technology and the perception of high anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The "History of Anesthesia" section explicitly states, "Rapidly changing technology and the perception of high anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality galvanized the specialty. In 1984, Ellison C. Pearce, then President of the ASA, established a standing committee on Patient Safety and Risk Management."

**3. Based on the historical context provided regarding the introduction of the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA), which intravenous anesthetic was noted to be particularly effective at suppressing pharyngeal reflexes, permitting LMA insertion without muscle relaxants?**

**Section 1: Introduction and Overview**

A) Ketamine

B) Etomidate

C) Propofol

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The "Intravenous Anesthetics" subsection notes, "Its popularity in Britain coincided with the introduction of the LMA, and it was soon noted that propofol suppressed pharyngeal reflexes to a degree that permitted the insertion of an LMA without a need for either muscle relaxants or potent inhaled anesthetics."

### **Section 2: Basic Science and Fundamentals**

**4. According to the Gell and Coombs classification described in the text, which type of hypersensitivity reaction is characterized by the interaction of sensitized T-cell lymphocytes with specific antigens, leading to a delayed response that peaks at 40 to 80 hours?**

**Section 2: Basic Science and Fundamentals**

A) Type I (anaphylactic)

B) Type III (immune complex)

C) Type IV (delayed hypersensitivity)

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The chapter on "The Allergic Response" defines Type IV reactions as resulting "from the interactions of sensitized lymphocytes with specific antigens." It further specifies that these delayed hypersensitivity reactions manifest in 18 to 24 hours and peak at 40 to 80 hours.

**5. A surgeon notes that a patient's wound appears hypoxic and acidotic. According to the principles of wound healing described, what is the primary metabolic process by which activated neutrophils contribute to this local environment?**

**Section 2: Basic Science and Fundamentals**

A) The release of proteases that degrade the extracellular matrix, consuming local oxygen stores

B) The respiratory burst, where oxygen and glucose are converted to superoxide, hydrogen ion, and lactate

C) Anaerobic glycolysis due to a lack of mitochondria, which produces lactate as the sole byproduct

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The chapter "Inflammation, Wound Healing, and Infection" explains that in activated neutrophils, "the respiratory burst, in which oxygen and glucose are converted to superoxide, hydrogen ion, and lactate, accounts for up to 98% of oxygen consumption." This process directly contributes to the hypoxic and acidotic state of the wound.

**6. A researcher is designing a clinical trial to evaluate a new anesthetic agent. To minimize bias and ensure the treatment groups are balanced for baseline attributes that might predispose subjects to a particular outcome, which element of experimental design is considered the most potent scientific tool?**

**Section 2: Basic Science and Fundamentals**

A) Using detailed case reports from initial administrations of the agent

B) Blinding the outcome assessors to the treatment assignment

C) Randomization of subjects into treatment groups

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The chapter "Experimental Design and Statistics" states, "The randomized, controlled clinical trial is the most potent scientific tool for evaluating medical treatment; randomization into treatment groups is relied on to equally weight the subjects of the treatment groups for baseline attributes that might predispose or protect the subjects from the outcome of interest."

**7. A patient with a known genetic polymorphism affecting thrombotic pathways is scheduled for major surgery. Based on the "perioptome concept," how should the anesthesiologist evaluate this patient's risk for an adverse postoperative event?**

**Section 2: Basic Science and Fundamentals**

A) The risk is determined solely by the presence of the genetic marker, irrespective of the surgery

B) The risk is primarily related to the choice of anesthetic agents, which can activate the polymorphism

C) The risk is a function of the interaction between the patient's static genetic predisposition and the dynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stressors

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The chapter "Genomic Basis of Perioperative Precision Medicine" defines the perioptome concept as highlighting "the intersection of an individual’s genome with exposure to surgical stressors and anesthetics leading to a set of phenotypic entities." This indicates that risk is not static but is realized through the interaction of genes and environmental (i.e., surgical) stress.

### **Section 3: Cardiac Anatomy and Physiology**

**8. According to the text, which of the following correctly identifies the three primary functions of the heart's flexible cartilaginous skeleton?**

**Section 3: Cardiac Anatomy and Physiology**

A) Pacing the heart, conducting electrical impulses, and providing myocardial contractility

B) Supporting the valves, resisting pressure forces, and providing an insertion site for subepicardial muscle

C) Storing calcium, providing coronary blood flow, and regulating heart rate

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The "Cardiac Anatomy" chapter explicitly lists the three primary functions of the heart's skeleton as: "(1) support the translucent, macroscopically avascular valves; (2) resist the forces of developed pressure and blood flow within the chambers; and (3) provide a site of insertion for superficial subepicardial muscle."

**9. A patient with severe, uncontrolled hypertension develops subendocardial ischemia despite having no flow-limiting coronary artery stenosis. According to Laplace's law and the principles of cardiac physiology, what is the most likely mechanism for this phenomenon?**

**Section 3: Cardiac Anatomy and Physiology**

A) Coronary vasospasm induced by high circulating catecholamines

B) Markedly increased LV pressure and myocardial oxygen demand in the subendocardium due to pressure-overload hypertrophy

C) Reduced diastolic filling time from tachycardia, limiting coronary perfusion

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The "Cardiac Physiology" chapter explains that in LV pressure-overload hypertrophy, "the subendocardium is exposed to marked increases in LV pressure and myocardial oxygen demand that render it more susceptible to ischemia." This combination is described as being especially deleterious even without a frank coronary occlusion.

**10. During a normal cardiac cycle, what event signifies the beginning of diastole and is responsible for producing the second heart sound (S2)?**

**Section 3: Cardiac Anatomy and Physiology**

A) The closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves at the start of ventricular contraction

B) The rapid inflow of blood from the atria into the ventricles

C) The closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves when ventricular pressure falls below arterial pressure

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The "Cardiac Cycle" subsection states that when aortic and pulmonary artery pressures exceed their respective ventricular pressures, "These pressure gradients cause the aortic and pulmonic valves to shut, causing the second heart sound (S2). This event signifies the beginning of diastole."

### **Section 4: Anesthetic Drugs and Adjuvants**

**11. What is the primary reason that anticholinesterase drugs used for neuromuscular blockade reversal must be administered with a muscarinic blocker like atropine?**

**Section 4: Anesthetic Drugs and Adjuvants**

A) To enhance the nicotinic effect at the neuromuscular junction

B) To prevent the untoward muscarinic effects of bradycardia, hypotension, and bronchospasm

C) To block the ganglionic effects of acetylcholine and prevent hypertension

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The chapter on "Neuromuscular Blocking Agents" clearly states that protection with atropine or other muscarinic blockers is necessary to "prevent the untoward muscarinic effects of bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, or intestinal spasm."

**12. A patient receiving trimethaphan for controlled hypotension develops fixed, dilated pupils. The neurosurgeon is concerned about assessing neurologic status. Based on the text, this pupillary change is a known side effect that:**

**Section 4: Anesthetic Drugs and Adjuvants**

A) indicates central nervous system toxicity and requires immediate discontinuation of the drug.

B) is a sign of inadequate anesthesia and requires deepening the anesthetic level.

C) obscures important eye signs, making it an inferior choice compared to nitroprusside for neurosurgery.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The "Neuromuscular Blocking Agents" chapter notes that with trimethaphan, "The patient’s pupils become fixed and dilated during administration, which obscures eye signs, an important consideration for neurosurgery. In this regard, it is distinctly inferior to nitroprusside."

### **Section 5: Preoperative Assessment and Perioperative Monitoring**

**13. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification System table, how is a patient with a severe systemic disease that results in substantive functional limitations, such as poorly controlled diabetes or a history of MI more than 3 months ago, classified?**

**Section 5: Preoperative Assessment and Perioperative Monitoring**

A) ASA II

B) ASA III

C) ASA IV

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The provided table in the "ASA Physical Status" section defines an ASA III patient as "A patient with severe systemic disease" with "Substantive functional limitations; One or more moderate to severe diseases."

**14. A 55-year-old patient with a history of stable angina is scheduled for an intermediate-risk noncardiac surgery. The patient reports being able to walk up two flights of stairs without shortness of breath or chest pain. According to the principles of preoperative cardiovascular assessment, what is the most important predictor of perioperative risk that helps define the need for further testing?**

**Section 5: Preoperative Assessment and Perioperative Monitoring**

A) The patient's age and gender

B) The results of a baseline electrocardiogram

C) The patient's exercise tolerance

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The "Preoperative Assessment" chapter states, "Exercise tolerance remains one of the most important predictors of perioperative risk for noncardiac surgery and helps define the need for further testing and invasive monitoring."

**15. A preoperative evaluation clinic is developing a protocol for ordering laboratory tests to reduce costs and iatrogenic harm. Based on the provided text, what is the most appropriate guiding principle for ordering preoperative tests like a complete blood count or coagulation studies?**

**Section 5: Preoperative Assessment and Perioperative Monitoring**

A) All patients over the age of 50 should have a full panel of tests to establish a baseline.

B) Tests should be ordered based on positive findings from the history and physical exam or anticipated surgical disturbances, not as a routine screening.

C) The surgeon's preference should be the primary determinant for which laboratory tests are ordered.

**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The "Preoperative Testing" subsection explicitly states that "Routine laboratory screening tests produce only minimal benefits in healthy patients" and that tests should be ordered "on the basis of positive findings from the history and physical examination or from anticipated physiologic disturbances during surgery, such as blood loss."

**16. An anesthesiologist is evaluating a patient for an urgent but not emergent procedure. The patient has several poorly controlled comorbidities. The surgeon is pressing to proceed immediately. According to the text, what is the primary conflict the anesthesiologist must resolve in this situation?**

**Section 5: Preoperative Assessment and Perioperative Monitoring**

A) Determining if the patient's insurance will cover additional preoperative testing and consultations.

B) Accommodating the surgeon's schedule to maintain operating room efficiency and throughput.

C) Weighing the risk of morbidity from delaying the surgery against the potential benefits of further diagnosis and optimization of the patient's condition.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The "Preoperative Assessment" chapter notes, "The approach to urgent procedures is less well defined. The anesthesiologist and surgeon must weigh the risk of morbidity of operative delay against the benefits of establishing associated diagnoses that can influence patient management."

### **Section 6: Basic Anesthetic Management**

**17. What is considered the gold standard for verification of successful tracheal intubation?**

**Section 6: Basic Anesthetic Management**

A) Visualization of the endotracheal tube passing through the vocal cords

B) Presence of bilateral breath sounds and chest rise with ventilation

C) Sustained detection of exhaled carbon dioxide

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Key point 7 in the "Airway Management" chapter states, "The gold standard for verification of tracheal intubation is sustained detection of exhaled carbon dioxide."

**18. An anesthesiologist is planning an ambulatory surgery for a healthy adult. To ensure a rapid recovery and minimize the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), which combination of maintenance agents would be most ideal according to the text?**

**Section 6: Basic Anesthetic Management**

A) Isoflurane and intermittent fentanyl boluses

B) A continuous ketamine infusion with midazolam

C) Propofol, desflurane, or sevoflurane

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The "Anesthetic Maintenance" subsection highlights that for ambulatory anesthesia, two primary concerns are speed of wake-up and incidence of PONV. It then states, "Propofol, desflurane, and sevoflurane have characteristics that make them ideal for maintenance of anesthesia for ambulatory surgery."

**19. A patient receiving sedation for a procedure under regional anesthesia becomes unresponsive and requires airway support. This scenario highlights a key principle of sedation management, which is that:**

**Section 6: Basic Anesthetic Management**

A) regional anesthesia frequently fails during long procedures, necessitating conversion to general anesthesia.

B) all sedated patients require an advanced airway to prevent aspiration.

C) sedation is a continuum, and the provider must always be prepared to rescue the patient from a deeper level of anesthesia than intended.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The "Anesthetic Maintenance" subsection explains, "Patients will routinely drift between depths of sedation, thus it is imperative that the anesthesia provider or supervisor be able to rescue a patient from a deeper level of anesthetic than was anticipated."

**20. A CRNA is faced with an unanticipated difficult airway after induction. Mask ventilation is inadequate, and an initial intubation attempt has failed. According to the ASA Difficult Airway Algorithm philosophy described, what is the most critical next step to prioritize?**

**Section 6: Basic Anesthetic Management**

A) Immediately perform an emergency cricothyrotomy to secure the airway.

B) Administer a reversal agent to wake the patient up from anesthesia.

C) Call for help and immediately attempt ventilation with a supraglottic airway (SGA) to restore oxygenation, avoiding task fixation on intubation.

**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The "Airway Management" chapter, in discussing the ASA guidelines, emphasizes avoiding task fixation and moving to alternative techniques. The provided algorithm graphic shows that if intubation fails and ventilation is inadequate, the next steps are to call for help and attempt an alternative device like an SGA before proceeding to an emergency invasive airway. This prioritizes oxygenation over intubation.
