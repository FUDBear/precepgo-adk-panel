# Clinical Scenario: ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy)

**Generated:** 2025-11-08 01:50:51

## Case Information

**Case:** ECT (Electroconvulsive Therapy)
**Code:** PSY-ECT-001
**Description:** Electroconvulsive therapy for treatment-resistant depression.

## Patient Information

**Name:** Victor Adams
**Age:** 61 years
**Categories:** ENT, Geriatric

## Scenario

You are precepting Michael Johnson, a 3rd-year SRNA, during his anesthesia rotation in the psychiatry suite. The next patient is Victor Adams, a 61-year-old male with a history of laryngeal cancer, status-post total laryngectomy, who now has a permanent tracheostomy. He is scheduled for his third session of ECT for treatment-resistant depression. In pre-op, Mr. Adams appears anxious and communicates with a hoarse, electronic voice via an electrolarynx. He confirms he has his permanent, uncuffed Shiley #6 tracheostomy tube in place. Your plan includes induction with methohexital and muscle relaxation with succinylcholine. The primary anesthetic challenge is managing the airway for the brief period of apnea to ensure adequate pre-oxygenation and ventilation before the seizure is induced. The attending CRNA asks Michael, 'Given the brief duration of this procedure, what is your primary plan for managing ventilation after we induce anesthesia?'

## Decision Options

### Option A: Replace with Cuffed Endotracheal Tube

Remove the patient's permanent uncuffed tracheostomy tube and replace it with an appropriately sized, cuffed endotracheal tube (e.g., a 6.0 cuffed ETT) through the stoma. This ensures a sealed, definitive airway, allows for reliable delivery of positive pressure ventilation without a leak, and facilitates accurate end-tidal CO2 monitoring.

**Considerations:**
- Provides optimal airway control and prevents aspiration.
- Eliminates leak during positive pressure ventilation, ensuring adequate oxygenation.
- Carries a risk of stoma trauma, bleeding, or creating a false passage during exchange.

### Option B: Ventilate via Existing Uncuffed Trach

Leave the patient's permanent uncuffed tracheostomy tube in place. After induction, connect a resuscitation bag directly to the 15mm adapter of the existing tube and provide gentle positive pressure ventilation to pre-oxygenate the patient prior to the stimulus.

**Considerations:**
- Minimally invasive, faster, and avoids manipulation of a mature, chronic stoma.
- Reduces patient anxiety and discomfort associated with tube exchange.
- Significant potential for an air leak around the uncuffed tube, which may lead to inadequate ventilation and oxygenation.

## Best Answer

**Recommended Option:** Option B

**Rationale:**

Option B represents the most prudent initial approach for this very brief procedure. The primary goal is pre-oxygenation, which typically requires only a few positive pressure breaths. Exchanging the tracheostomy tube (Option A) for such a short duration introduces unnecessary risks, including stoma trauma, bleeding, and the potential for airway loss, which outweigh the benefits of a perfectly sealed airway. A gentle bag-mask technique via the existing trach is usually sufficient, and any minor leak can often be compensated for by applying gentle pressure to the skin around the stoma. The plan should include having a cuffed tube immediately available as a backup if ventilation proves inadequate.

## Learning Points

- Anesthetic management for patients with a permanent tracheostomy must balance the need for airway security against the risks of manipulating a chronic stoma, especially for brief procedures like ECT.
- ECT causes a biphasic hemodynamic response: an initial, brief parasympathetic surge (bradycardia, hypotension) followed by a profound sympathetic response (tachycardia, hypertension) lasting several minutes. Anesthetic management aims to blunt this response.
- Post-ECT side effects include headache and myalgias from succinylcholine-induced fasciculations. A relevant post-op pain strategy involves pre-treatment or post-treatment with non-opioid analgesics like ketorolac or acetaminophen.
- Choice of induction agent for ECT (e.g., methohexital) is critical as it can affect the seizure threshold and duration, which is the therapeutic endpoint of the treatment.
