# Clinical Scenario: Lobectomy with Double-Lumen Tube

**Generated:** 2025-11-03 09:39:39

## Case Information

**Case:** Lobectomy with Double-Lumen Tube
**Code:** CAR-LOBE-001
**Description:** Surgical removal of a lobe of the lung using a double-lumen endotracheal tube.

## Patient Information

**Name:** Maria Santos
**Age:** 28 years
**Categories:** Obstetric, Adult

## Scenario

Maria Santos, a 28-year-old G1P0 at 36 weeks gestation with gestational diabetes and mild preeclampsia, is scheduled for a left robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) lobectomy for a newly discovered mass. Her BP is 145/92 mmHg on labetalol. After a smooth intravenous induction and placement of an arterial line, you have successfully intubated her. She is now in the right lateral decubitus position. The surgeon is anxious to begin and emphasizes the need for rapid and complete lung collapse for adequate surgical exposure and robotic arm placement. You must now decide on the definitive method for one-lung ventilation (OLV). The primary concern is choosing the most appropriate lung isolation technique considering the surgical approach and Maria's physiological state.

## Decision Options

### Option A: Place a Left-Sided Robertshaw Double-Lumen Tube (DLT)

This approach involves using a disposable polyvinyl chloride (PVC) Robertshaw-type DLT, which is considered a standard of care for achieving lung separation. This tube provides two separate lumens, allowing for independent ventilation and the most reliable isolation of the operative lung from the ventilated, dependent lung. Confirmation of placement will be performed with a fiberoptic bronchoscope.

**Considerations:**
- Provides the most effective and rapid lung collapse, which is a key requirement for VATS/RATS procedures as noted in the Barash text.
- Offers superior protection of the dependent lung from contamination (e.g., blood, secretions), which is critical given that RATS can be associated with a higher rate of intraoperative bleeding than VATS.
- If postoperative ventilation is required, the DLT may need to be exchanged for a single-lumen tube, exposing the patient to the risks of airway manipulation during a tube change.

### Option B: Use the Existing Single-Lumen Tube (SLT) and Place a Bronchial Blocker (BB)

This technique involves advancing a bronchial blocker through the already-placed single-lumen endotracheal tube into the left mainstem bronchus under fiberoptic guidance. The cuff on the blocker is then inflated to isolate the lung. This method avoids the placement of a larger, more stimulating DLT.

**Considerations:**
- Avoids a tube exchange if postoperative ventilation is needed, reducing airway manipulation at the end of the case.
- The isolation provided by a BB's low-pressure, high-volume cuff is considered less reliable than a DLT's, posing a risk if significant bleeding occurs.
- Lung deflation may be slower as air must escape around the blocker, and the blocker itself can become dislodged more easily during surgical manipulation.

## Best Answer

**Recommended Option:** Option A

**Rationale:**

Placing a Double-Lumen Tube (DLT) is the most appropriate choice. The provided Barash text highlights that RATS lobectomy is associated with a higher rate of intraoperative injury and bleeding than VATS. It further states that a DLT is particularly important when protection of the dependent lung from life-threatening contamination is required, as the isolation provided by a bronchial blocker is less reliable. Given the increased risk of bleeding with RATS, ensuring robust protection of Maria's single healthy lung outweighs the potential risk of a planned, controlled tube exchange at the end of the procedure.

## Learning Points

- The decision to use a DLT versus a bronchial blocker is based on anesthesiologist preference and surgical factors; however, a DLT provides the most reliable lung isolation, which is critical in cases with a high risk of bleeding or contamination.
- As noted in the provided text, robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) may be associated with a higher rate of intraoperative bleeding compared to traditional VATS, making superior lung protection a key anesthetic goal.
- Rapid and complete lung collapse is essential for adequate surgical exposure in VATS and RATS procedures because, unlike open thoracotomy, direct lung retraction is not possible.
- Preoperative assessment must consider the entire perioperative course, including the potential need for postoperative ventilation and the associated risks of exchanging an airway device.
