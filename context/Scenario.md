**Generated:** 2025-11-05 23:21:38

## Case Information

**Case:** MAC Local TIVA Tendon Repair
**Code:** ORT-MACT-001
**Description:** Tendon repair under monitored anesthesia care with total intravenous anesthesia.

## Patient Information

**Name:** Liam Nguyen
**Age:** 8 years
**Categories:** Pediatric

## Scenario

You are assigned to a MAC TIVA case for an 8-year-old male, Liam Nguyen, who weighs 45 kg. Liam is scheduled for a tendon repair on his right hand. His medical history is significant for well-controlled asthma (last used albuterol inhaler 3 months ago) and a mild developmental delay. His pre-operative airway exam is unremarkable, but you note his smaller airway diameter. In the OR, Liam is initially cooperative. You've established IV access, applied standard ASA monitors, and started a propofol infusion at 75 mcg/kg/min with oxygen at 2L/min via nasal cannula. He is calm but awake. The orthopedic surgeon is now ready to perform the local anesthetic block, which will involve multiple injections and is the most stimulating part of the procedure. As the surgeon approaches with the needle, Liam becomes visibly anxious, starts to whimper, and begins pulling his arm away. His SpO2 is 99%, RR is 18, and BP is 105/65 mmHg. You must quickly deepen his sedation to ensure he remains still and comfortable for the block, without compromising his fragile respiratory system. Your preceptor asks, 'Aisha, what's your plan?'

## Decision Options

### Option A: Bolus Propofol and Increase Infusion Rate

Administer a 20 mg bolus of propofol and increase the infusion rate to 125-150 mcg/kg/min. This approach relies on the rapid onset and titratability of propofol to quickly achieve a deeper level of sedation sufficient to tolerate the block. The infusion can be decreased immediately after the injections are complete.

**Considerations:**
- Propofol provides no analgesia; sedation is the primary mechanism for tolerating the stimulus.
- There is a significant risk of dose-dependent respiratory depression, apnea, and airway obstruction, especially in a pediatric patient with asthma.
- This approach requires heightened vigilance to manage the airway and be prepared for immediate intervention (e.g., jaw thrust, positive pressure ventilation).

### Option B: Administer a Sub-anesthetic Ketamine Bolus

Keep the propofol infusion at its current rate and administer a small IV bolus of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg, approx. 22 mg). This strategy utilizes ketamine's profound analgesic and dissociative properties to manage the procedural pain while maintaining spontaneous ventilation and airway reflexes.

**Considerations:**
- Ketamine is a potent bronchodilator, which is a significant benefit in a patient with a history of asthma.
- There is a risk of increased oral secretions, which could potentially irritate the airway.
- Potential for psychomimetic effects (emergence delirium), though the risk is lower with sub-anesthetic doses and co-administration of propofol.

## Best Answer

**Recommended Option:** Option B

**Rationale:**

Administering a sub-anesthetic ketamine bolus is the superior choice for this specific patient. Liam's history of asthma makes him vulnerable to bronchospasm, and ketamine's intrinsic bronchodilatory properties offer a protective benefit. This approach provides potent analgesia for the painful stimulus of the local injection while preserving respiratory drive, a critical safety factor in a spontaneously breathing pediatric patient under sedation. While a propofol bolus could work, it carries a much higher risk of apnea and airway obstruction, which would be a more dangerous event in a child with a fragile respiratory system. The benefits of bronchodilation and maintained respiratory drive with ketamine outweigh the manageable risk of increased secretions.

## Learning Points

- In pediatric MAC cases, especially for patients with reactive airway disease, anesthetic choices should prioritize the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation and airway reflexes.
- Ketamine, in sub-anesthetic doses, is a valuable adjunct to propofol infusions for painful stimuli, offering profound analgesia and bronchodilation.
- Anticipating and managing the most stimulating portions of a MAC procedure is key to preventing patient movement and avoiding the need for excessive sedation, which can lead to adverse events.
- Understanding the synergistic effects of sedative-hypnotics and the unique pharmacodynamics in pediatric populations is crucial for safe anesthetic practice.
