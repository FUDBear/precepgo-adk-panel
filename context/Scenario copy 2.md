**Generated:** 2025-10-31 00:30:17

## Case Information

**Case:** Cataract Surgery with Intraocular Lens (IOL) Implantation
**Code:** OPH-CATA-001
**Description:** Surgical removal of a cataract and implantation of an intraocular lens.

## Patient Information

**Name:** Sarah Mitchell
**Age:** 45 years
**Categories:** Trauma, Adult

## Scenario

Sarah Mitchell, a 45-year-old female (65 kg), arrives in the preoperative area from the trauma bay following a motorcycle accident. She has an unstable pelvic fracture with a pelvic binder in place and is hemodynamically fragile with ongoing, suspected internal bleeding (BP 90/50, HR 115). She is drowsy but arousable. An urgent ophthalmology consult diagnosed a traumatic cataract with a small, self-sealing globe rupture in her right eye, requiring immediate cataract extraction and IOL implantation to preserve vision. The orthopedic team is preparing for subsequent angiography and pelvic fixation, but the eye surgery is deemed more time-sensitive. You are the CRNA assigned to the case. The ophthalmologist, accustomed to routine cases, suggests the standard peribulbar block with sedation. You must decide on the safest anesthetic plan for this high-risk patient undergoing a typically low-risk procedure.

## Decision Options

### Option A: Peribulbar Block with Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC)

Proceed with the ophthalmologist's preferred technique. Administer a peribulbar block to achieve akinesia and analgesia for the eye. Supplement with carefully titrated intravenous sedation (MAC) to ensure patient comfort and immobility. This approach is the standard of care for cataract surgery and avoids the hemodynamic swings associated with general anesthesia induction and emergence.

**Considerations:**
- This patient is not a typical candidate for outpatient surgery; her significant comorbidities and instability challenge the standard approach.
- The patient's drowsy state may make it difficult for her to remain still and cooperative during block placement and the procedure itself.
- If the patient's hemodynamic status deteriorates rapidly due to pelvic bleeding, managing a resuscitation under sedation is significantly more challenging than with a secured airway.

### Option B: General Anesthesia with Endotracheal Intubation

Advocate for and proceed with general anesthesia. Perform a rapid sequence induction, securing the airway with an endotracheal tube. This provides definitive airway control, allows for controlled ventilation to avoid hypercapnia (which can increase IOP), and offers the ability to more aggressively manage the patient's hemodynamic instability from her trauma.

**Considerations:**
- Induction of general anesthesia can cause significant hypotension in a hypovolemic patient.
- Laryngoscopy, intubation, and coughing or bucking on the tube during emergence can cause substantive increases in IOP, potentially leading to vitreous loss in an open globe.
- This approach deviates from the common practice for cataract surgery, which is typically performed under local or regional anesthesia.

## Best Answer

**Recommended Option:** Option B

**Rationale:**

Given the patient's systemic instability from an unstable pelvic fracture and ongoing hemorrhage, her safety is the paramount concern. General anesthesia with a secured airway is the safest choice. It allows for optimal control of her hemodynamics, ventilation, and airway, which is critical in a patient at high risk for cardiovascular collapse. While GA carries risks of IOP elevation, these can be mitigated with a smooth induction, deep anesthetic plane, and controlled emergence. The risk of losing control of a crashing, sedated patient under MAC (Option A) is far greater than the manageable risks of GA in this context. This choice reflects the Barash principle that MAC should mean 'maximum anesthesia caution,' and the anesthetic must be individualized to the patient, not just the procedure.

## Learning Points

- The anesthetic plan must be tailored to the patient's overall physiological condition, which may override the standard anesthetic for a specific procedure. A low-risk surgery on a high-risk patient becomes a high-risk anesthetic.
- In trauma patients, prioritizing airway security and hemodynamic stability is crucial, even for non-trauma related surgeries.
- While controlling intraocular pressure (IOP) is a key requirement of ophthalmic surgery, it must be balanced against the patient's systemic life threats. Anesthetic techniques can be modified to minimize IOP spikes during general anesthesia.
- Effective communication and advocacy with the surgical team are essential when the patient's condition necessitates a deviation from the surgeon's preferred or routine anesthetic plan.

## References

This scenario is based on principles discussed in Barash, Chapter 49: Anesthesia for Ophthalmic Surgery. Specifically, it applies the concepts of individualizing care for patients with significant coexisting diseases, the importance of controlling intraocular pressure, the requirements of ophthalmic surgery (Table 49-1), and the overarching principle that anesthesia care for even low-risk procedures must consider the entire patient ('maximum anesthesia caution').
